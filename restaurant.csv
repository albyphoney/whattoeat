This was one of my favorite reasons for being able to call LA my home for 8 years.  I have since moved back to nor cal but I still have wet dreams about this place.  I am not sure what everyone else gets but I get the garlic chicken.  What isn't there to like?  They give you a huge chicken soaked in this butter garlic situation with onions buttery rice plantains and black beans.  I can't recall the price off of the top of my head but it is a steal.  I always include the avocado salad because this is the real kicker to the dish.  My hubby always prepares the avo salad with the oil vinegar salt and pepper and you eat it with the chicken... AMAZING!!  We just visited the in-laws and dropped by Versailles... it's been about a year or so but it still hit the spot.  I can't stress how much the avo salad really brings this entire dish together but do yourself a favor and order it.""]","['Sangria Plantains and best of all Bob Saget.  I\'ve been coming here for several years now and I have always loved this place. The menu has stayed the same but visually has changed drastically! It started off as a dingy paper menu years ago but now it\'s fancy complete with pictures!  Let me just say first of all that the parking situation here particularly on a Thursday Friday or Saturday night is terrible. Thankfully I live a short walking distance away so I take a stroll out there every now and then to enjoy a glass (or pitcher!) of sangria. Thankfully I am a stone\'s throw away from this Versailles location.  More on the sangria. It just has the right taste. Just enough sweetness plenty of tang with a few slices of orange. I can plow through this like fruit punch hell almost like water. It\'s dangerous. Being a brand new graduate student at UCLA a few years ago there was nothing better than driving over (yep dangerous) to Versailles (when I didn\'t live anywhere near it) and having a pitcher of sangria for $14.99 after a hard day. Unfortunately those days are over. I can\'t handle a pitcher of sangria anymore merely a glass or two. But to my benefit I don\'t spend as much money. The sangrias prices have upped to $19.99 per pitcher and remained at about $3.99 per glass.  Also... their bread! Devastatingly simple. They cut off pieces of freshly (daily) baked bread toast it and spread some butter sauce on top. Just enough to get it a little soaked but make the paper they deliver it on absolutely clear. Yes some cardiac arrest is in the works but oh so worth it at Versailles. Sometimes I must ask for a second order.  I usually stick with the whole chicken the roast pork or the fried pork chunks (sorry I can\'t remember the numbers) and I am always happy. ALWAYS. You may think that is ""oil"" at the bottom of your roast pork or chicken pile but no that is their special marinade dubbed ""Mojo sauce"". It is a very tangy lemon-y mixture that they grill fry and cook everything with at their establishment.  Even more fantastic is that they include with nearly every dish a solid helping of moro (black beans within!) rice and my personal favorite plantains! You may not expect it but mix the beans and rice together and with the excess dip your plantains. Heck dip your plantains in the excess moro sauce. Soaking up the tangy/salty juices along with the contrast of the sweet plantains? HEAVEN. Absolute perfection.  Another dish I also enjoy here (and had tonight!) is the Cuban Sandwich. A nice helping of pickles swiss cheese and mustard on a 9-10 inch roll along with a generous slice of ham and roasted pork leg to top it off. Throw on some tapatillo sauce and some ketchup for your fries and you\'ve got yourself a perfect meal that you can take on the go in a pinch! I\'ve done that meal for lunch many times switching off to the Bistec (steak) sandwich as well as the roast pork sandwich. Fortunately they recently updated the menu to allow you to get the sandwich/fries meal for dinner. For many years this was not possible and they told you so.  And what do you know?! A celebrity sighting! Bob Saget and his girlfriend were sitting at the table behind us. They had the whole chicken and the roasted pork. I like his choices (AND his style)!

We got seated and figured out quickly what we wanted to order. I raised my hand like a good 4th grade student but everyone ignored me.  My friend tried to flag down a server and even after making eye contact with 2 no one came to help us. Eventually a server who was helping the table next to us stopped by to take our order.  I got the Tamales appetizer (2 pork tamales) and my friend ordered Bistec de Pollo.  My tamales were ok but there was very little pork.  In fact I would say that pork made up about 5% of each tamal.  The sauce it was in was not bad but the abundance of completely raw onions on top of the dish was not appetizing.  My friend's chicken was hard cold and not good at all.  He said that he could make better chicken at home and he's no gourmet chef.  It was also topped with enough onions to make an army cry but at least his onions were slightly cooked.  The plantains that came with the dish were pretty good but how can anyone mess up frying plantains right? The side of rice that came with the dish was stale and clumpy.  Yuck!

Service was top-notch and the portions are enormous making the $$ notation really a $ unless you eat enough for 4. The bread before the meal was amazing and I couldn't stop munching on it.  I ordered the lechón asado which was very well seasoned but a bit dry for my taste. (I would have ordered their famous chicken if I weren't afraid that it would have been wayyyy too dry as chicken usually is.) The plantains were delicious and the rice and beans... were rice and beans. I wasn't a big fan of the raw onions on top but they were really good the next day!  Since I only ate a third of my plate and a friend gave me a third of hers I had enough lechón and onions to experiment with the next day. For lunch I browned the onions and reheated the pork in it for a bit making the onions much more palatable and the pork a tiny bit less dry. For dinner I put the remaining pork on a sandwich--also yummy.  Next time I'll order the ropa vieja. If they could manage to make ropa vieja dry... they wouldn't have gotten such good ratings.

You never know if it could just be an off-night during the summer or if you're about to sign yourself for some late-night bathroom fun.   While this definitely doesn't make the winner's circle for my favorite DC Thai restaurants it certainly wasn't bad. We both started off with shrimp tom yum soup that was flavorful and authentic. My fiance had the drunken noodles and I had tofu with peanut curry both of which were palatable and large portions if not the best I've ever eaten. I ended the meal with some mango and sticky rice that was the perfect consistency and taste--it's one of my favorite sweet treats.   The restaurant itself is clean but nothing to write home about in the decor department. It looks slightly dated. The service was polite and efficient.   It did seem that they got a lot of orders for pick-up while we were in there and given that it's at 14th and K I imagine it's more of a lunch crowd. But it'd be hard to believe it will be around much longer if what we experienced on Friday was the typical dinner rush."", ""I keep telling myself I'm not coming back here but it never fails I come back.  Last time I was there the manager made a stink because I had a gift certificate he thought was expired (it wasn't... it was valid for a year but that didn't stop him from call the 1-800 number of the place I purchased the certificate from to check).  The time before that the waiter forgot about us entirely. And the time before that the waitress did the same (on top of not saying one word to us).  Still for some reason or another at least once every 6 weeks or so I find myself back in the small restaurant staring mindlessly at the thai art replicas and pasty lilac walls.  It's convenient (around the corner from work) and the food is decent but the real reason I keep coming back is Bangkok One set my world on fire... well really just my drink.   The Flaming Volcano as its called is the biggest drink in town but has the smallest price (like $6 or something) and comes with a fiery lemon set afloat on a wave happy hour goodness.  The best thing about the Flaming Volcano is that unlike the implied effects of its name the drink actually goes down quite smoothly and is down right refreshing.  It was the perfect pairing for my seafood fried rice which was so spicy it cleared up my sinuses.  Also the Flaming Volcano doesn't hit you while you are drinking it... it kicks in about 30 minutes after which I loooooved!  Made for a good base buzz as I continued with my festivities for the night.  LOL!  Recommendations for a Bangkok One Visit: 1) Getting a Flaming Volcano 2) Go at lunch time for food (same portions and quality as the dinner menu but significantly cheaper) but  3) don't come at noon.  It's packed. Come after - more like 1:30ish.  That's perfect. 4) If you are on the job and don't want to drink in the afternoon come after work for drinks.  They are all uber cheap.  It's like having happy hour specials around the clock and without promotion. 5) Food-wise any of the fried rice dishes or Drunken Noodles are great.  I got the Goong Bikini for an appetizer (mostly because I liked saying the name so much) and it was pretty good... odd but good.  Sticky rice is ok for dessert but not a must have.""]","['Came here for lunch with two friends after a meeting in the area.   One of the worst places I\'ve been too in a while.

(Note: Trader Joe\'s/ ""Trader Ming\'s"" pad thai from a box isn\'t that bad but food from a restaurant shouldn\'t taste like it was just microwaved. )   The only reason this place didn\'t get one star is because my other friends soft shell crab was well cooked it was overly sweet  but still tasted pretty good.

Started with the summer rolls (vegetables and shrimp in a rice paper) which had a good flavor were fresh and came with a peanut sauce. I would strongly recommend these. Also ordered the goong bikini appetizer (whole shrimp in friend  an egg roll type wrapper) with a sweet and sour sauce. These weren't bad but I would stick with the summer rolls instead.  I had the thai iced tea to drink. Give this a try...it's basically sweet tea with half and half or creme mixed in. It's really filling but give it a shot with your meal.   I had the massuman curry (beef with potatoes onions and carrots in a curry sauce). The beef was well done and not fatty the curry sauce had some sweetness and some spice with it. It almost reminded me a little bit of a beef stew but spicier and came with rice.  Depending on what you get it can be a little pricey for an everyday lunch but it's a definite place to go for an office lunch or to stop by once or twice a week. If you get it to go and skip the appetizer or drinks it's around $10.00 before tip tax etc.  Skip the mediocre places downtown and give this place a try instead.""]","[""Went  here on a Monday night during my business trip with a coworker.  The place was pretty empty (it was around 9 on Monday night) but the waitress came right out to us.  She made some rec's for us as my friend is Vegan pretty much.  Prices are very low to mid range and portions were really good for $15.  We had the tofu pad thai w/o egg (i kno it needs egg but is ok w/o XD) tofu red curry (friend asked for it to be extra spicy and it was XD) vegetable dumplings and Volcano seafood entree.  Waitress brought our drinks and then a young man started taking care of us seems like he had limited English proficiency but he really tried to answer my friends questions so points for that.  After ordering all this food we asked about how long it would be and he said 5 minutes it was more around 20 minutes.  After the little wait the food came out piping hot and was decent for the price range.  I would consider it pretty average Thai food but I was looking for something better than a quick fast food chain.  I left satisfied with some pad thai for the next day.  Took off a star because the waitress had an attitude when she had to explain DC's plastic bag thing to us and he it would cost me extra money.  Maybe she was having a bad day but in DC I'm sure she serves plenty of people who don't know about the bag policy.  Took another star off because the restaurant was warmer than outside and my friends dinner had tofu in it when she requested no tofu.  I'd go there again if I had to but I wouldn't make any special trips."", 'Came here for lunch with two friends after a meeting in the area.   One of the worst places I\'ve been too in a while.   We all ordered Thai Iced Teas and an order of fried vegetable dumplings to start. The Thai Iced Teas were flavorful but tastedl like at least half a cup of sugar had been put in each one I finished about half of mine and felt a bit nauseous. As for the the dumplings they weren\'t horrendous but were clearly from a frozen bag 5 dollars for 8 dumplings? I could have bought a bag of 32 for 4 dollars at an asian market.   For our main dishes. I got the salmon in red curry sauce lunch special. My friends got the soft shell crab and the pad thai.   My salmon came out and the inside was STILL FROZEN.  They apologized profusely and brought me out another one. I know this place isn\'t super clasy but it really turned me off to know that my food was not fresh at all and simply heated after being taken out of a freezer and served to me. My friend\'s pad thai was sub par and tasted like it came out of a Trader Joe\'s pad thai box. (Note: Trader Joe\'s/ ""Trader Ming\'s"" pad thai from a box isn\'t that bad but food from a restaurant shouldn\'t taste like it was just microwaved. )   The only reason this place didn\'t get one star is because my other friends soft shell crab was well cooked it was overly sweet  but still tasted pretty good.   I hear they have good happy hour specials though so I might be back. I do not recommend this place though.', ""The BKK dumplings kicked ass and were an amazing starter.  The rest of the food was pretty mediocre though. We had fried tilapi fillet in a generic brown flavorless sauce and some bland drunken noodles. The dishes were good enough and fresh but didn't make any impression on my palate.  I will probably be back because the location is convenient and it isn't expensive. Also since we were the only couple in the restaurant at 7pm on a tuesday service was super.""]","[""I had dinner there the first weekend I moved to DC. I can't remember what I had or what my friend had. But I don't remember that we were for or against it. I don't even remember what I had. So not memorable.  I craved thai yesterday for lunch after my friend from Philly reminded me of our fave spot there. I went back b/c its th eonly thai place in walking distance (in the cold) near my office on 15th and H. I got take out.   Orderted the Tom Yum soup. It was fine but more coconutty than lemon-grassy which was weird. I love Thai and always order the Tom Yum so I could tell the odd difference right away.   Druken noodles. Also a favorite of mine. It was soupy. Yeah not like chili pasty. But all the soupy-ness was at the bottom of the dish. The flat noodles were still white. I am used to it being seasoned. The chicken tasted odd. I didn't finish most of my dish. I always finish my thai.   Maybe b/c it was take out and I didn't sit in that accounted for odd taste. But usually take out food isn't horrible.   I can't say positive or negative for the service. Order was ready on time as they said on the phone in 15 minutes. Thats about it.   I had to compensate for my awful thai lunch by going for thai dinner. And luckily my roomate new of a fabulous spot within walking distance to wear we live in Truxton Circle. 4th and NJ Ave I think. AWESOME drunken noodles and pad thai. Fresh salad. and great service. Will try their soup nexttime. I think it was Beau Thai but I can't remember the name.   p.s. DC Noodle House has great Pad Thai and Drunken noodles.  Wish they opened one near my job. Philly if you are ever there has multiple awesome thai places."", ""OK I made the mistake of going in at 12:30 during the lunch rush. After 10 minutes I noticed that the people who came in at the same time as me AND the people who came in after me had already ordered and gotten their drinks. After 15 minutes as I was getting up to leave the waiter came over and took my order. 25 minutes later my soup arrived. The table of 6 that sat next to me after I had been there for 20 minutes was already eating their entrees!. It really wasn't that busy as there were several empty tables. I may go there again even though it was awful because the food is ok and it is right by the office. I hate having to settle for mediocre just because it's close by."", ""We hit up Bangkok One this weekend because we'd seen it walking by a few times and decided to check it out. This was a bold move at the time because we were literally the only people in the restaurant on Friday night at 7. You never know if it could just be an off-night during the summer or if you're about to sign yourself for some late-night bathroom fun.   While this definitely doesn't make the winner's circle for my favorite DC Thai restaurants it certainly wasn't bad. We both started off with shrimp tom yum soup that was flavorful and authentic. My fiance had the drunken noodles and I had tofu with peanut curry both of which were palatable and large portions if not the best I've ever eaten. I ended the meal with some mango and sticky rice that was the perfect consistency and taste--it's one of my favorite sweet treats.   The restaurant itself is clean but nothing to write home about in the decor department. It looks slightly dated. The service was polite and efficient.   It did seem that they got a lot of orders for pick-up while we were in there and given that it's at 14th and K I imagine it's more of a lunch crowd.

Tucked in amidst a number of high-end swanky restaurants (replete with of course sofas outside) is Bangkok One. Of my time in DC perhaps the strangest restaurant experience I\'ve had.  First of all the smell of the restaurant is very strange. It smells like a mixture of pineapple and sewage. Did not smell good at all.  Second the service was prompt though this could be explained by the fact that my girlfriend and I were the only people in the restaurant at 6:30 on a Friday.   Third the appetizer the Vegetable rolls tasted like they could have come out of a freezer at your local Giant. The Thai iced coffee tasted about what one would expect of Thai Iced Coffee while my gf got the Thai Iced Tea (way too sweet).  Dinner and dessert: the worst pad thai I had ever eaten...ever. Noodles seemed like a mixture of undercooked and overcooked (if possible). Though the taste was ok (more peanuty than pad thais I\'ve had before) it still was very sub-par. Dessert though was bar none the WORST dessert I have had in DC. Another review had classified the ice cream as ""old and stale""- we got a red bean ice cream and that encapsulated the ice cream perfectly.  The only reason I give this two stars: it has a coupon on  http://restaurant.com  so our meal cost significantly less than it would have. Good if you want a cheap meal but otherwise not worth it.', '$3 beers( chang) all day and yummy food! For dessert try the coconut ice cream....', 'We ate here while visiting DC one night when we realized we weren\'t ""dressed"" to eat at the other places in the neighborhood. Although it was mostly empty that night it had plenty of seating; I assume it gets busy during lunch hour. We had the specials with perfectly cooked shrimp and those clear glassy noodles yummy. Pad Thai was great as well but the best part was the Thai Iced Tea. Very aromatic and tasty. Few other couples came in as we were eating but the waiter was still very attentive and nice. Decor is kind of cool they have artifacts in little glass cases that are very pretty and nice conversation starters. Food is good people were nice and price was right!']","[""My friend said 'Meet me at Bangkok One'. It rang a bell because this restaurant was wedged between Tattoo and Lima - I remembered walking past it before. The restaurant was completely dead - I kept telling my friend perhaps it's still early in the evening until I tried the food. We had a waiter who didnt understand a word we said and he stood there for minutes we felt really awkward. I wanted the Thai iced tea but I asked for that it was not too sweet and he couldnt understand that. After looking at this puzzled face I asked for a coke instead.  For appetizer I ordered the mango salad - it came out chunks of mangos with some onions and peppers I was dumbfounded. I expected the mango salad as unripened shredded mango like a papaya salad boy was I wrong about that. For the entree I ordered the Siam noodles with special spicy sauce it was just seafood with the wide rice noodles and not the least bit spicy. I was disppointed with the dinner. The food tasted fine but it didnt wow me. Poorly executed Thai food.  With the same waiter we asked for him to break change for a $20 again he stood there for 5 minutes struggling to figure out what we were asking for. In the end an older gentleman walked up to us and took care of it."", ""We hit up Bangkok One this weekend because we'd seen it walking by a few times and decided to check it out.

The restaurant was very quiet compared to its neighbor DC Coast. We walked in the restaurant thinking maybe we won't get to eat there because they might be closed soon. To our delight the very polite and timid Thai fella told us they are open till at least 11 if not midnight. Upon learning that we flopped our butts down as he led us to our booth passing one other couple.  Since it was so late we didn't want to pig out like we usually would after a long day at work so we decided to go with one appetizer and one entree to share. We ordered the Yum Mango (special of the month) as an appetizer which was mango onions tomatoes green beans in a spicy cilantro lime dressing and drunken noodles an an entree. Of course we asked for the dishes to be prepared Thai spicy. The Yum Mango came out really fast and it was DELICIOUS!!! The sweetness of the mango and the sourness of the lime dressing fired up with Thai chili flakes it was such a nice kick for your tastebuds. The drunken noodles came out 2 minutes after we finished our appetizer and it was the best drunken noodles I've had yet in the DC area. Usually when you get drunken noodles the noodles come out swimming in a plate of oil and everything looks dark and greasy which is precisely the reason I almost never order drunken noodles unless the craving for spicy grease creeps up on me. But the drunken noodles at Bangkok One was so different and wonderfully tasty. When the dish came out I couldn't see the noodles. As I found out as I dug my chopsticks in the noodles were covered by a yummy thick layer of stir-fried chicken (or beef or pork depends on what you order) and the noodles seemed and tasted like they were just boiled real quick instead of stir-fried. So they boiled the noodles put them on the plate and then poured the chicken and the sauce over it. Since chicken doesn't absorb much grease and the noodles are boiled the dish was light yet tasty.   I was so content after my appetizer and entree that I didn't feel the need to order dessert for once. Now I know where I'll be going for a late dinner next time I'm stuck in the office again while everybody else is out enjoying happy hour.""]","[""I had dinner there the first weekend I moved to DC.

Came in today for lunch because it was close to work and once I got seated they brought out some dishes that had burnt spices and the whole half of the restaurant started coughing. People were requesting to have their food boxed so that they could leave. The smell in the restaurant was awful and the table in front of me was covering their nose with a napkin while eating.   I had vegetable tom yum which tasted nothing like tom yum soup I had at any other Thai restaurant. Basically it was spicy broth with some carrots which is not really tom yum. The Shrimp and Tofu Pad Thai had TWO shrimps and no tofu and no peanuts it was just noodles and tasted completely off. What a rip off!!!! I will never come back!!!!']","[""A great lunch spot in downtown DC.  Started with the summer rolls (vegetables and shrimp in a rice paper) which had a good flavor were fresh and came with a peanut sauce. I would strongly recommend these. Also ordered the goong bikini appetizer (whole shrimp in friend  an egg roll type wrapper) with a sweet and sour sauce. These weren't bad but I would stick with the summer rolls instead.  I had the thai iced tea to drink. Give this a try...it's basically sweet tea with half and half or creme mixed in. It's really filling but give it a shot with your meal.   I had the massuman curry (beef with potatoes onions and carrots in a curry sauce). The beef was well done and not fatty the curry sauce had some sweetness and some spice with it. It almost reminded me a little bit of a beef stew but spicier and came with rice.

The outdoor seating is a great idea makes everyone feel as if they are eating somewhere important but you arent. You are eating right next to the super fast and dirty and loud road which makes the gross meal even grosser.   I ordered the Vegetarian Pizza something I assumed would be simple to make (if Dominos can do it so can a few heavy set Italians)  The sun dried tomatoes were burnt to a CRISP it smelled like a pair of orthopedic shoes the old lady on my street wears when she glares at me from her stoop.  My boyfriend got the Seafood Pasta which was pretty much a few old mussels and 54 garlic cloves. Our server forgot our second round of drinks and just really had better things to do then be at Caffe Graffiti.  All and all...pass on this place.

I'd definitely head back here again provided I could sit in the more intimate back area away from the bar metal tables and bright lights.  The restaurant personality of Caffe Graffiti is quite nice encompassing about 10 tables in a darker back area presided over by a wall-sized arched brick window overlooking the street. The food is typical pasta chicken and seafood in mammoth portions for under $17.  The calamari appetizer is tasty crispy without a hint of sogginess. I could do without the vegetables mixed in though because if I wanted vegetable tempura I would have ordered that. It's kind of hard to tell sometimes if it's a cauliflower of small piece of calamari.  I had the Rigatoni Boscaiola which was perfectly cooked but a bit too saucy for my liking. Of course I foolishly finished the whole thing and slipped into a food coma unable to even get in a second glass of wine.  Despite a lack of room for more wine when in a Caffe that neglects to serve coffee instead opting only for espresso beverages one must see what's up. The espresso shot was sweet with only a touch of bitterness and sugar wasn't really necessary. I love that it's served in the traditional way without even a hint of an offer for cream.  It's strange because its seems that despite being on the visible front of the North End we had no problem finding a seat on a Friday night at 8.

The food is typical pasta chicken and seafood in mammoth portions for under $17.  The calamari appetizer is tasty crispy without a hint of sogginess. I could do without the vegetables mixed in though because if I wanted vegetable tempura I would have ordered that. It's kind of hard to tell sometimes if it's a cauliflower of small piece of calamari.  I had the Rigatoni Boscaiola which was perfectly cooked but a bit too saucy for my liking. Of course I foolishly finished the whole thing and slipped into a food coma unable to even get in a second glass of wine.  Despite a lack of room for more wine when in a Caffe that neglects to serve coffee instead opting only for espresso beverages one must see what's up. The espresso shot was sweet with only a touch of bitterness and sugar wasn't really necessary. I love that it's served in the traditional way without even a hint of an offer for cream.  It's strange because its seems that despite being on the visible front of the North End we had no problem finding a seat on a Friday night at 8. They take reservations but if you're shut out of other places in the area you'll most likely find perch here. Our server Frankie was super friendly to myself and my ladyfriend and was really enjoyable overall."", 'A couple of weeks ago GroupOn had a deal that was good for $40 worth of food for only $20 at Caffe Graffiti and I was excited to visit. So last Friday night my boyfriend and I ventured into the North End. I lucked out and parked outside which was definitely a high point.   We had eaten a late lunch that day so we planning to maybe split an app have dessert and maybe a drink or two. I told the hostess this but when the waiter realized he seemed a little miffed that we were not ordering dinner. He actually seemed grouchy the whole time. Mind you the place was empty so he should have been glad to be waiting on anyone.   For a beverage we each ordered the Pomegranate Fizz. It was pretty good but definitely low alcohol content. I think they waved the St. Germain over it. We decided to order the fried calamari to which our waiter proclaimed ""good choice no one else makes it like us."" Well he was right but not in a good way...we were served what appeared to be a large portion of fried calamari but upon closer examination you could see that they ""fill"" the order with fried vegetables (Cauliflower carrots peppers etc). I would not have minded the addition of the vegetables but for the fact they were drenched in lemon and salt making them unpleasant to eat.   Throughout our time there I mentioned to the waiter that we wanted dessert. However he never asked us if we wanted it and after ordering a second round of drinks (cordial of Sambuca and a SoCo Sour) he brought us the check. I had to remind him we wanted to dessert.   At that point we should have just left but the Baccio Gelato was calling my name so we had some. That was all that looked appealing to me in the case (they do not have a dessert menu).   Sad to say I will not be adding Caffe Graffiti to my elite list of favorite spots in the North End.', ""My boyfriend and I had a groupon for this place. We arrived around 8pm on a Friday night and got a table for dinner right away. He wanted to seat us in the middle of the room but I prefer sitting next to a wall (I don't know why just something comforting about sitting next to a wall) so I asked him if he could move and he was really nice about it and moved us right away (after cleaning the table next to the wall).  The service was really great the wait staff was friendly. We ordered fried calamari for appetizer and it was more than enough for the 2 of us. Yes they do add some filler vegetables but it wasn't that much.  My boyfriend go pork tenderloin and I got the veal parmesan and they were both decent-sized. I normally don't eat a lot so I had veal parm for lunch the next day. Both dishes were pretty good and tasty but we considered it average for North End. The pork tenderloin was really good but the potatoes were waaay salty. And my veal parm with penne pasta was probably something I could make at home so in my opinion not worth the $17 we paid for. But the groupon made it worth it!""]","['After reading the other reviews I think we can all agree that the service here is horrible. Our waiter was a very obnoxious little man indeed. The main reason we came here was because we looked at their lunch menu outside and not being very hungry wanted to order something quick and small. When he gave us the dinner menus I asked him if they had the lunch menu that was advertised outside and his only response was ""No"" before turning and walking away. If it wasn\'t so cold outside we probably would have got up and left but we stayed and ordered some very ordinary Caesar salad and undercooked Calamari. I doubt if we\'d ever waste our time and money here again.', 'SHORT VERSION: GLAD I had a 1/2 PRICE PRE-PAID CARD... This place was empty and the waiter was still impatient &amp; annoyed.  We wanted to eat outdoors but arrived to find their patio EMPTY.  The waiter tells us we should eat inside because it\'s getting cold out and other diners have moved inside.  SO...we let him lead us in...  ...to another EMPTY DINING ROOM!  Where are these ""other diners?""  Despite the lack of work for the waiter he still gave off an air of IRRITATION ATTITUDE &amp; ANNOYANCE.  I was served 6 or 8 RAVIOLI...FOR A DINNER PORTION.  I\'m a small girl and I left hungry.  SALAD WAS NOT INCLUDED.  The prices were NOT CHEAP.  The ravioli was NOT MEMORABLE.  The atmosphere was NON-EXISTENT.', 'So as promised I returned to Cafe Graffitti to try out the actual cafe section. It could not have been a better evening. We were lucky enough to be seated by an open window overlooking the city.  My boyfriend and I split the Caprice\'s pizza and chicken Cesar salad. Both were absolutely delicious. The chicken came out hot on the salad (I happen to hate cold chicken) and the dressing was thick and creamy. The pizza was also pretty tasty all the ingredients were fresh.  The service was decent but it is the ambiance that makes this place. It has a little bit of an ""high end"" feeling without losing the cafe vibe. Definitely a great place to grab a drink whether it is coffee or wine. Just make sure if you want dinner you specify you want to eat in the cafe!']","[""Meh... disappointing   Let me start with what was great about this place:  The view of the city while sitting outside. Yup that's it.  I should have known better and made a reservation somewhere else on a Saturday evening in the North End. This was the only place that we could find that had a table open... never a good sign.   Our waiter was more interested in smoking on the side of the building than remembering to bring our drinks or water. The food - blah. We started with the eggplant rollatini - rubbery and unimpressive. For dinner I had the shrimp scampi it had absolutely no flavor... and the shrimp was dry. Desert you ask? No thank you!   I will not be making a second appearance here."", 'Ambiance:  We decided to check this place after buying a ""Groupon"" type deal for half off. We ended up going for an early dinner at 5:30 as we were going to see a comedy show after. When we got there the windows were open and only a few tables were seated. The windows being open would have been great altough this was a chilly June evening. Lucky for my girlfriend they ended up closing them halfway through our meal so she wasn\'t shivering the whole time.  Food : I got the special a seafood risotto and my girlfriend got the chicken parm. The risotto was nice and creamy tons of seafood but for someone who loves seafood thought it had a little too much of a seafood mix and taste. The presentation was great but not eater friendly I had to remove the tails from the shrimp and remove the shells.   Service: Waiter was nice and quick. Food was out extremely fast and his recommendatons were good.  Overall: Food was good just a little expensive. They only had beer and wine. Not sure if I would go back.']","[""I had lunch at Cafe Graffiti with a few of my friends over Memorial Day weekend and I was impressed!

But I had the Fusilli di Casa which was phenomenal.  Most of the food on the menu is stuff I'd make at home but when I'm home I don't have the experience of people watching on a patio in the North End.

The atmosphere of this place was nice.    My experience with the service was not so good.  When we ordered there were no plates or settings and it took a while for bring them out while our appetizers were sitting on the table getting cold.  And it was just placed at the end of our table we had a group of 9.  The table wasn't that long but it was not handed out to us.  Alot of us ordered the Steak.  only one of them came with a steak knife.  We asked for knives so again food was just sitting there while we waited for a while for knives.    I had ordered mine with a side of fries.  But after my steak came out they than came to tell me that they had run out of fries would I like something else.  So I ordered fried plantaines instead.  I was pretty much done eating and no plantaines.    My friend had ordered a shake waited a while still no shake.  The waitress comes and tells her the manager is in the basement getting stuff ot make it or something to that extent.  10 minutes later still nothing.  Than finally came back and told us the machine was broken!  Still at this point no plantaines. We were all done eating and the check had came out.  I complained to my friend on the table about it and I guess the waitress heard me and came over and apologized and said sorry we already charged you though.    Uh - what was I suppose to say to that?  Still ended up paying for it even though we never got it.    So the experience that I had here was TERRIBLE.

Here's what I loved about the place:  - gorgeous warm friendly vibrant decor that transports you to somewhere tropical and makes you forget the sketchy neighborhood you just passed through to get here  - super-friendly waitress who patiently answered our millions of qs  - ridonkulously huge portions of so much food our spacious table for 6 literally could not hold any more plates before our sides had finished arriving  - amazing prices for the ridonkulously huge portions of food  Here's what didn't thrill me: The food itself really wasn't that amazing.  Our group got the Picadera Merengue (sampler platter with fried meats green plantains and yucca fries) and Queso Frito (fried cheese) to start our meal. The fried cheese was tasty (how can you go wrong with fried cheese?) but the various meats were over-grilled to the point of being dry and stiff. The plantains were nicely done but the yuvva fries could have been moister (having backpacked through Peru I know this is possible without sauce).  For entrees I got the Almejas (mussels) opting for Creole sauce for an authentic dish. The mussels were pretty fresh but the sauce was about 1 degree too salty. Good a first then you realize you're chugging water like a sorority girl just to make it through the next bite. On the flip side the Spanish rice with beans that came as my side was completely dry and tasteless. (I did combine the two when I took the rest of the dish home for leftovers and voila problem solved!)  Other dishes I tried included the Filete de Chillo al Gusto (red snapper filet) in both coconut and Creole sauce and both were very well done (meat nice and tender). The Chuletas de Cerdo Frita (center cut fried pork chops) were too dry and tough. The chicken mofongo came in a huge pyramid of ridiculous quantity but it was a bit too dry and tasteless for me.  So overall while I enjoyed trying out a cuisine I don't often get to have the food itself didn't seem very well-cooked. Perhaps it is a Dominican thing to have drier meats but I like my meat as tender as possible. Glad I came not in a rush to come back. Though that orange + evaporated milk concoction is pretty tasty.""]","['Went there for a birthday dinner recently and overall the food wasn\'t spectacular.  I got the grilled calamari which was a bit overcooked.  A couple of my friends got the steak and they claimed it was fairly decent so I guess it varies depending on what you order.    However my low rating really comes from service.  I would advise you double fist and order your ""drinks"" at one time because it will take an hour for your next round.  We ordered some appetizers to share across the table amongst 8 ppl and they gave us 2 plates with 2 forks - literally utensils for the two ppl who ordered for the table.  Needless to say we had to ask for more plates.  There were no refills on water and there were cases of poor attitude from the bus ladies who were clearing our table.    For the price of their entrees which really is not cheap (15-20) you could do better.  I wouldn\'t go back again.', ""Authentic Dominican food!!! The decor is so warm and welcoming inside kinda takes u back to DR =) The service is also very friendly nice and pretty quick. My fav dish to have is the berenjena asada but they don't don't make it all the time call ahead to see if it's on the menu that night. Spanish rice and the mofongo are also excellent. The platanos maduros are a bit dry. If you're in the mood for something sweet to drink try the morir sonado it's delicious!

We started with the sampler platter (Picadera Merengue) which was good to pick over as we waited for the entrees to come.  We then got the Mofongo (i wasnt a huge fan but another member in our group said they\'ve sampled mofongo ALL over and this place had the best).  the ""Ceviche de Camarones"" was very refreshing tasting and the Frituritas were good but the Queso y Salami Frito was only so-so.  My favorite dish was the sweet plaintains (Platanos Maduros). Again it was fantastic to have such a variety of dishes all very distinct and delicious!  As for beverages I got a ""fresh"" passionfruit drink - but I thought it was too sweet and didnt seem like 100% fruitjuice.   Only thing i wasnt a fan of was the location - its only on-street parking off a busy road or else you have to take a bus to get there; didnt seem like the safest neighborhood to be in either but during the day seemed fine.']","[""I'm Dominican but I eat Dominican food only rarely.

My experience with the service was not so good.  When we ordered there were no plates or settings and it took a while for bring them out while our appetizers were sitting on the table getting cold.  And it was just placed at the end of our table we had a group of 9.  The table wasn't that long but it was not handed out to us.  Alot of us ordered the Steak.  only one of them came with a steak knife.  We asked for knives so again food was just sitting there while we waited for a while for knives.    I had ordered mine with a side of fries.  But after my steak came out they than came to tell me that they had run out of fries would I like something else.  So I ordered fried plantaines instead.  I was pretty much done eating and no plantaines.    My friend had ordered a shake waited a while still no shake.  The waitress comes and tells her the manager is in the basement getting stuff ot make it or something to that extent.  10 minutes later still nothing.  Than finally came back and told us the machine was broken!  Still at this point no plantaines. We were all done eating and the check had came out.  I complained to my friend on the table about it and I guess the waitress heard me and came over and apologized and said sorry we already charged you though.    Uh - what was I suppose to say to that?  Still ended up paying for it even though we never got it.    So the experience that I had here was TERRIBLE.  But on the brighter side - the food was really good here.    The steak with the Chimichurri sauce was excellent and cooked perfectly."", ""O yes this is one of my favorite restaurants.

The Dominican Republic was colonized by Spain and they speak Spanish but the menu is very different then you'd find at a Spanish resteraunt.  Fortunately for me I like Dominican food.   It took a few minutes of standing there with the waitress and her boyfriend looking at me for her to come up and ask (via hand signals since her mouth was full of food) how many and if I wanted a table.  Some people probably would have been put off but I thought it was funny.    The dining room is large with red and blue walls and big paintings with lots of bright colors.  Its a bit crowded with big tables and oversized whicker chairs so if you're looking for quiet and privacy this probably isn't your spot.  When I first came in they were playing Latin pop fairly loudly but switched it to sort of light rock partway through.  Still fairly energetic but minus the 808's.  I ordered the grilled steak with peppers and onions a side of sweet fried plantains and a limonade (fresh lemonade) which to my delight tasted like it had been made with coconut juice.  Great combo if you haven't tried it.  The food was excellent and there was a lot of it.  Steak was a bit tough but that's not unusual for a latin-style thin-cut fried steak.  The grilled veggies that came with and the side of plantains i ordered balanced the flavors out perfectly.  I had enough leftovers to eat a small meal late at night at my hotel.  This is a great place and worth checking out."", ""I live in Dorchester so there are more than enough Dominican/Caribbean style restaurants around. However most of them are simply a counter with a few chairs. Not to say the food isn't great but the ambiance leaves alot to be desired. Luckily I just discovered Merengue which is actually a Dominican RESTAURANT. It's a decently sized place and was hoping when I went this past Sunday. The first thing I noticed was that my party was the only white people in the place which is clearly a good sign if you are getting Dominican food. And Merengue did not disappoint with great shrimp ceviche and fired cassava appetizers. My main course was a whole red snapper in creole sauce sure it's hard to pick around the bones but you can't beat the flavor! Like Miguel said it's def not cheap but the food is great and VERY filling."", 'Saturday night we didn\'t quite know what we wanted to eat but we definitely wanted another ""Cafe Cesaria experience"". Something ethnic and delicious and not expensive. After searching all the usual websites Abby found Merengue.  Located on Blue Hill Ave a short 7 minute drive from our condo we arrived to find easy street parking. (Crossing the street though wasn\'t as easy.) We entered in to find a bar area on the left and a dining area on the right. We get seated in a booth but are quickly asked to move to a smaller table because the entire booth was reserved. No biggie. The dining room is very colorful and there were plenty of people enjoying drinks and hanging out. This is definitely the type of place that it seems everyone there knew each other. (Sure enough in the middle of our meal a large group came in and the couple sitting next to us gave them all hugs and hellos and moved tables together so that they can eat together.)  The menu is big and with tons of options. Abby went with Filetillo (Steak Tips Cooked in Creole Sauce with Green Peppers Red Peppers and Onion) and I went with Chuletas a la Jardinera (Fried Pork Chop Garden Style Topped with Green Peppers Red Peppers and Onion). We probably should have gotten the Mofongos but completely forgot to order it. That was ok though because our sides (Spanish rice and white rice with beans) were plenty huge and both dishes came with a small salad too. We also ordered a drink that was very reasonably priced.  Our meals were fantastic. The pork while a couple of bites were dry was perfectly cooked with a nice crust. The white rice was plain but I cut up the pork along with some of the peppers and onions and ate it all together. Very nice. The beans also were delicious. Abby\'s steak was in a nice tomato-y sauce and was perfectly cooked as well. I didn\'t think the Spanish rice was anything special but she definitely did. Also the portions for both were huge. This was a great dinner.  Merengue met all expectations and is a spot I\'d come back to again. The service and the food was fantastic and well above average. The whole fish that our neighbor got looked amazing and I\'d like to give that a try next time. The prices were also in the sweet spot with most items around $10. I give Merengue a very very strong 3 and 1/2 out of 5.

Seems crazy considering that mediocre raw fish could have painful consequences so I guess that makes me a risk taker. Or just too lazy to walk to a 4-star joint.  Sanraku is tucked within the Metreon building with a nice view of Yerba Buena garden. Like most sushi joints the ambience is nothing to marvel at - it's simple clean and gets the job done. So let's talk sushi...  The menu is totally standard with some bento box lunch specials and your run-of-the-mill rolls. I always have to have my seaweed salad so I was lured by the special Sanraku seaweed salad claiming to have 3 different types of seaweed on a bed of greens. For $10 I had high hopes. Yes it came with 3 types of seaweed but in measly little portions; the majority of this pricey salad being lettuce not seaweed. The dressing was more acidic than flavorful and I couldn't wait for my sushi to arrive...this salad was just not cuttin' it.   We shared a few of the fancy rolls; you know the ones that Americans order (with spicy mayo sauce and tempura fried this and that). They were mostly delicious and definitely filled the sushi void. Service was sporadic (who exactly was our server? We weren't sure) and during the lunch rush that became a problem when we needed to jet back to the office for a meeting. Next time we'll tell them we're on a tight schedule maybe that'll help.  Pricey sushi considering the location. But if you're in the area and in desperate need of rawness Sanraku can fix you up in an A-OK fashion.""]","[""Sushi in the Metreon? You'd be surprised and amazed!

We can usually squish in a party of 8 or so and once the unpleasant business of rearranging the chairs and getting ourselves into our seats is done it actually doesn't feel that squished!  It has been said before but I'll say it again. Even though it's tacked onto the Metreon and the decor is kind of standardly facelessly Japanese the food is really quite good. The fish is fresh the miso is warm and salty and neither I nor my coworkers have ever had a bad dish to the best of my knowledge. The menu isn't that inventive but it has all your favorites - soba tempura California roll and all - prepared very nicely. They get a bit more creative with their special rolls of course and I even ordered the chef's pick sushi lunch last time and got something that (I think) contained squid tobiko and a hot sauce that was surprising and tasty. No not surprisingly tasty I was pretty sure I would like it.  In San Francisco which is also the land of a billion sushi restaurants you might not feel compelled to go out of your way to eat at Sanraku. But if you happen to be in the area and are looking for a sizeable reasonably-priced lunch comprised of standard Japanese fare by golly Sanraku might just be your place!""]","[""Food = good. (I enjoyed the yellowtail sesame chicken rock-n-roll roll and some stuff but I was a tad concerned by the nearly black color of the tuna roll.......)  Service = efficient.   Decor = simple.   Prices = moderate. Happy Hour is okay if you can figure out which items are actually a better value if you order more than one...;) (it's 3 to 7 p.m.) Most items are under $5"", ""When the BF told me that we were meet up with his college friends in the city at a Japanese place I was PSYCHED. I love sushi with a fiery passion and hadn't eaten it in awhile.   First we got sorta lost looking for the place. After going up a few floors in the Metreon then going outside and passing the door we found it. The door is a bit inconspicuous and doesn't quite look like the entrance to anything. And the restaurant is oddly shaped as other Yelpers have mentioned; it's long and skinny.   As soon as we got there and greeted the group rounds of hot sake were ordered and promptly downed. And after a few cups I realized the BF and I hadn't eaten anything! We finished off the rest of the appetizers (gyoza and some random rolls) then we all ordered our dinners.   The BF and I shared the sashimi salad deluxe (such delicious fresh fish with a great ginger vinaigrette) the rock 'n roll (eel &amp; avocado roll which was good but the brown eel sauce covered up the eel) and some miso soup (decent but not very hot). And he ordered some nigiri which was good even though I can't recall what fish it was.   The rest of the group ordered the dinner specials which included teriyaki of some type (salmon beef etc) with rice and steamed veggies sushi (sashimi or CA roll) and miso soup. I heard no complaints from them and they cleaned off their plates so I assume it was good!  And the hot sake. We managed to finished off 13 rounds of hot sake between 4 of us (2 of the girls stopped at 1 cup which is less than half a round). And we tried some nigori (unfiltered) sake which I prefer and the boys have sake bombs.   Our waiter Jin looked a bit bored. Or lifeless but he took care of us and our wild sake-downing mess. And I managed to crack a smile out of him when I asked him for water refills. Cuz our sake-loving friends surely needed some more water ;)  OH and it was HAPPY HOUR before 7 so that's why the guys ordered hot sake like crazy people! Needless to say our pre-gaming dinner was a blast."", ""Some times the cravings just come and shake me through and through and try as I might I can't shake em off. This is the source of desperation.  So I take a deep breath and enter the Metreon. That's right. Sushi in a megacomplex always tastes better right? Is that why there's always a ridiculous line? Can't be their sloppily wrapped rolls two (cali and rock &amp; roll) of which cost me $18. Oof.  Hard up. That's when I'll come here again considering there's no other decent place in the walkable vicinity. And to the gardens I will go toting my Sanraku take-out consoled by the bright sun and cool welcoming grass.""]","[""Located inside the Metreon. Best oyster shooters I've ever had hands down! Their soft shelled crab with the salsa was aaaaaaamazing too as well as the spicy scallop roll or whatever it was they made. But the oyster shooters and soft shelled crab were to die for!!!! The sushi chefs also loooove to joke around! Great relaxing place for a late lunch"", ""Seating was prompt but service was incredibly slow on a Saturday night. The staff was friendly and helpful but they definitely neglected to take my order and deliver it in any reasonable time frame. I sat at the sushi bar and had to wait 30 minutes to get the first piece of fish from the time I ordered. The food was delicious and I would recommend the Uwajima roll (hamachi cucumber ginger scallions) and the scallop nigiri.   All in all it was a decent spot for Japanese food if you're in the SoMa area or watching a movie at the Metreon."", ""Having sushi at Sanraku was like....having sushi at a mall. Nothing spectacular yet we could appreciate that it was available at the Sony Metreon before catching a movie on the 3rd floor.  When the wait staff finally noticed us at the table they were friendly and accommodating. I have a soy allergy which throws the staff a curve ball here and there but our server was very graceful about it.  At best the sushi can be described as generic yet a step up from picking up sushi at the super market. With that said highlights included the spicy scallop roll and the monk fish liver and the regrets were absolutely the spider roll and the uni. Interestingly enough I could even criticize the rice here which was poorly seasoned and in general I'm not one to dwell much on rice.   I'd recommend getting the Katana a nice sake but get a big bottle if you're two at it. The small is very small.  Conclusively the bonus here was that I didn't have to settle for a Starbucks or popcorn dinner so thanks Sanraku for being around.""]","[""Really enjoyed my meal here last night. Had the mitsuri roll tonkatsu and nabeyaki udon. Wanted to rate it a bit higher but the nabeyaki udon didn't have bamboo shoots in it nor an egg! (My girlfriend is a bit of a connoisseur). Tonkatsu was good - no complaints there. The only thing about the mitsuri roll was that I could taste the propane on it.. but it was still pretty good.  The place seems to have a really good happy hour so I'll definitely be back to check that out!"", 'May be biased as I have worked down here for years... but Sanraku\'s sushi noodles and sesame chicken are all standouts!  SUSHI: Fish is all very high quality. Go for the 49er roll for fresh Bogi roll for savory and Hanabi Roll for smooth.   SESAME CHICKEN: I was in NJ and told a gentleman in the food and beverage business that I lived in SF. He said ""Do you know where to find the bests sesame chicken in the country? Sanraku"". It is very good fried savory served with salad. Get the combo with sashimi and you won\'t be disappointed.  NOODLES: The Nabayaki Udon is off the hook on a cold day. Tip from LL take the shrimp out ASAP to prevent from getting too soggy. Tip from me bury the egg deep down in the bowl to let it cook if you do not want a runny egg.', ""Plain and simple this is a nice little place! The service is a little slow. We wound up serving ourselves water when it became difficult to get anyone's attention. The food is very good though --- high quality delicious and worth the price.   I enjoyed the Sushi Lover's Platter (California roll tuna yellow tail salmon shrimp eel &amp; egg omelet). Hubby gave two thumbs up to the amazing udon probably the best deal on the menu! For just $11 you get a huge serving!!   One way in which this place has been totally remiss is that there is no children's menu. How could this be? There were so many families in the place while we dined. The Zeum is also located just across the street Yerba Buena offers a plethora of children's programming in its gardens and with the movie theaters and video arcades housed in the building there is certainly enough of a population to tap into. Come on Sanraku pull one together please! In the meanwhile I advise that you do as we did --- split an adult-sized dinner between two kids.""]","['tempura', 'tempura', 'tempura']","['sake', 'sake', 'sake']","['california', 'california', 'california']","['shrimp', 'shrimp', 'shrimp']","['spicy tuna', 'tuna roll', 'tuna spicy']","['hamachi', 'hamachi', 'hamachi']","['francisco', 'francisco', 'francisco']","['rock', 'rock', 'rock']","['scallop', 'scallop', 'scallop']","['egg', 'egg', 'egg']"

Perhaps my first mistake was ordering the snapper instead of the meat lasagna.  But the waitress recommended it and taking that advice was definitely a mistake.  Not only was it clear that the fish had been frozen (which I had expected) but it tasted old.  Considering the fish had been breaded and fried the fact that I could taste that it was old is really saying something.  The pasta and sauce that accompanied the fish was over salted (and no I am not one of those that never uses salt - in fact I use it liberally when I cook).

The Everett location will not leave you disappointed and its cheap as hell.']","[""You smell the smoke when you park even when the temperature is near freezing. Cafe Belo was our lunch destination and I was looking forward to meat meat meat.   The restaurant is nothing remarkable from an aesthetic standpoint and they definitely cater to the Brazilian crowd - all dozen or so TVs had soccer on at 1:00pm on a Sunday nary a NFL game to be found. The buffet was amazing. Veggies hot and cold rice dishes breads fried plantains (!) and much more. It was all fresh and tasty.   But veggies were not why I came. Beef brisket chicken wrapped in bacon marinated chicken breast dark meat chicken chicken sausage chicken hearts pork sausage roast pork... and it kept coming. The novelty of the service wore off as the task of consuming the meat began. It was all very very good. Fire kissed and seasoned just enough you had the option of different textures based upon where you were in the room - the first to get served got the crunchy well done exterior and those following got medium cuts. They switched it up so I had opportunities for both (which I took).   It wasn't the best meat I've ever had but it was delicious. And the quantity made it that much better. I can't remember the specific cost of the buffet/meat but the total bill for two meals soda and a tip came to $35.

Walzwerk is one of the few restaurants that live up to the 650+ (omg!) glowing reviews.  I went last night with the boyfriend to try out some delicious German cuisine. We arrived at 9:15 had drinks in our hand by 9:45 then a table by 10 which is according to Yelp closing time for them. Despite that the restaurant was extremely busy people were still enjoying each others company and hardly any bills were given (which explains why it took us so long to find a darn table). So this place understandably is quite the Popular Patty!   My God make reservations. Don\'t do what we did and think ""Oh it\'ll have died down by 9 on a Friday night."" BZZZ. WRONG. FAIL. END OF THE LINE FOR YOU MISS. We stood there like assholes for the majority of the time we were there because everyone else (probably) called in ahead.  My boyfriend drank the Franziskaner Hefeweizen ($6) all night and I the infamous Diesel ($4) - a funky concoction of beer and Coke. The only beer I really drink is during Oktoberfest so take my opinion with a grain of salt but.. the Diesel was ridiculously good. I mean it\'s effing hilarious how my mind was blown taking that first sip. Try the Diesel.   Eventually we got our food. It did not disappoint. The boyfriend ordered the Bratwurst ($15) and I tried the fish special they had going on ($19). Was it worth the wait? Heck yes. By 10 PM we were ravenous and heavy German food is just the answer. We both got mashed potatoes which were so good. It was just the right amount of creamy and soft. His bratwurst I\'m told was delicious as well as the sauerkraut that came with it. Mine the fish was super good too! It was a perfect combination of crispy and tender at all the right places. Might have been a tad too salty but the lemon sauce that was drizzled all over it and the green bean vegetables were soo good. If you\'re reading this review while they still have that fish special (that I cannot spell/pronounce or even fathom to attempt) please try it.  The building itself is tiny. Sooo small. I wish it were bigger. But it\'s pretty awesomely decorated with a picture of Karl Marx Vladimir Lenin and some guy who looks like Rutherford B. Hayes. (Who is he!) ETA: I am told he is Freddy Engels Karl\'s buddy.  There were only two waitresses at the time we were there. Both were extremely friendly and helpful. One took pity on us lowly newbies and offered to serve us drinks. (THANK YOU.) Later the other asked a couple patrons if they would give up their table for us while they sat in the couch. (DOUBLE THANKS.) They were super kind super generous. I feel like an ass coming back to the restaurant to question my itemized bill when everything was actually on the straight and narrow.   This review is getting almost TL;DR so I\'ll stop now. Walzwerk is awesome. This is going to be my new favorite German restaurant that I\'ll use and abuse every time I\'m in SF. (Too bad I\'m in SoCal!)  P.S. - They don\'t take AmEx!']","[""I've been here two times for dinner and both experiences have been rock solid. Whenever you're craving some good mashed potatoes and anything cabbage Walzwerk is your place to go. Don't forget to drink some of the awesome beers they have too."", ""Very good German food. I decided to come check this place out since the Schnitzelhaus on 9th and Folsom closed down :(  Great food; the salmon and beet appetizer was very good but it was very small. I liked my Jaegerschnitzel however it was a little small; I always say that a real schnitzel should be hanging off your plate it's so big. I have eaten schnitzel for every meal in Berlin Budapest and Vienna and also at Schnitzelhaus and Suppenkuche here in the city so I know what I'm talking about. While it was good it was not as good as the one at Schnitzelhaus (/whine). Also you have to make a choice between spaetzle and rottkraut which I think is total BS. You're already paying a high premium for this food the least they could do is give you a little cheap pasta or cabbage for free.  I felt the beer list was lacking. For this area it should not be difficult whatsoever to expand their beer list drastically. They could even buy it directly from City Beer Store a few blocks away on Folsom.  Great food but I felt it was too expensive and not enough. I was hoping this place would fill the hole that Schnitzelhaus left behind but it doesn't quite cut it. Schnitzelhaus was tiny and expensive like this place except their beer list was tremendous and the food and helpings were much better. Also the staff was much friendlier and the owner would regularly engage you in conversation and drink a beer with you.  If you want German food and you're in this area Walzwerk won't let you down but be prepared to spend a lot. If you want better food and more beer choices I would choose Suppenkuche except it does get pretty loud and busy in there whereas this place is tiny and more intimate."", 'These are a few of my favorite (German) things:  Foot-tall Radeberger beer spicy mustard and cold cut plate cute waiters with accents bratwurst with kraut potato pancakes the lamb rack special red berry pudding giant pictures of Marx.

The decor floor plan plates glasses salt and pepper shakers and well even the waiters are German. Walking through the front door of this place is like walking into an alternate dimension. After entering from an odd block it's like a secret German expatriate hideout.   The food is fantastic. Jagersnitzel that will blow your mind time and time again. Spaetzle that is too much to deal with. Even pickled herring in what looks like tartar sauce? Okay Walzwerk I'll eat it. Wash it down with a beer mixed with Coke? Why not? By the time they've charmed the pants off of you to fit more food into your ever expanding stomach you start to wonder how you ever got into this predicament.   If there is ever a place to lose your mind and go hog wild this is it. I'd go so far as to say it's my favorite restaurant in San Francisco and one of my favorites overall in the quality of experiences I've had there. Christmastime Gluwhein and cookies is a must for anyone looking to live in their lifetimes. The service is great and while it's not technically perfect (you might wait or get the wrong thing) like I said it's beyond charming. If this place ever closes down I will buy the property and encase it in glass preserving it like Lenin himself.   Walzwerk I left my heart in East Germany and I'm coming home to you."", ""This place is tiny!  Come early make reservations or expect to wait. We were seated within 10 minutes because there was a reservation that no showed. Our group ended up sharing a table with a senior couple. Because of this we were able to listen to an impromptu lecture on Jack Koeppler. Our elderly dining companions really made our night and we enjoyed their stories bantering and history lessons. Although I did politely decline the offer of their 37 yr old unemployed son.  Food was great. Janelle and I had the jager schnitzel and I also tried the beef roulade. Portions are pretty big but I managed to wipe my plate clean (of course). Only minor gripe I have is that I feel their prices are slightly high. For the type of food ingredients and preparation... I feel like most plates should have been a little less. I'm not complaining though because it really was delicious."", 'After seeing Walzwerk on Check Please! Bay Area my partner insisted on going there. I\'ve never had German food before and figured it was worth a try.  Having worked for a (crazy) German lady in the past I\'m quite familiar with their aggressive short demeanor. That prepared me to not take it personal when the hostess/waitress greeted me coldly. I asked for a table for two and she responded: ""I don\'t have anything!"" What a warm greeting! Usually this would be a trigger for my inner biatch to come out but in this case I considered it part of the ""theme"" of the restaurant.   The food was good although the vegetarian options are limited. I had the cheese spaetzle and my partner had the vegetarian roulade. The spaetzle was good and I loved the sides of pickled veggies. It was a weird combination but tasted very good together. The mashed potatoes served with my partners roulade were like crack!   For dessert we had the special of the day which was schokoladenpudding. Can you guess what that is? Chocolate pudding. Not very German but tasty.

The Sauerbraten ($18) is as the word suggests = sour. Hence very appetizing. The potato dumplings are unique! Its not the texture of a whole-boiled potato. But rather a little more chewy and flavorful. I believe there was bread incorporated in there.   The Schnitzel ($16) was good. I liked that it was not too dry as meat tend to be when fried. It was nicely moist and tender. Cold German beer ($6) to wash all the GOOD STUFF down! Excellent!  Finally we shared a nice little dessert- Red Berry Pudding ($6) which is FANTASTIC.

The cold dog really is exactly as they describe it - rum and butter cookies layered in fudgy/ganoche-y chocolate in the appearance of cake.

My husband's and other party attendee's pork dish was tender and done perfectly. However other dinner party attendee said his pork was dry. And from what I could see. It was truly rock hard dry. So chances are 33% totally dry and 66% chance of moist pork. I guess if it is a bit dry you might want to tell the waitress. It is suppose to be tender and moist. What happen? Too long off the stove?  Sauerbraten (Marinated Beef) with Potato Dumplings and Braised Red Cabbage: Pretty tasty Beef tenderized and moist. I defintely would like to go and try a full dish of this.

Some friends were in from out of town and their only slot to hang out with me during a busy family holiday weekend (Thanksgiving '07) was 8:30am on Saturday morning. Yes I'm a very good friend... or maybe just INSANE but I digress.   Near where my friends were staying in Tribeca is Odeon which seemed like a good breakfast option. In fact way back when I'd been in Odeon so late that it became early. I wasn't even aware that they close at all but apparently they do because this time when I came barreling into Odeon to look for my friends the staff all stared at me as if I had yes indeed THREE HEADS. Not two. THREE. A few sentences of clarification later relating to their hours of operation had me leaving just as quickly as I'd arrived. Not open until 10:00am. DAMN. Where to eat?    Since my friends were late a quick call on the phone landed the idea of Kitchenette which opened at 9:00. 8:45+(1) Starbucks preemptive caffeine run = time to go to Kitchenette.  Despite the plethora of pancake permutations (how about THAT alliteration HUH?) I opted for the goat cheese and herb omelet which enhanced with tomatoes turned out to be an EXCELLENT choice.  Maybe that's because you could slather goat cheese on a piece of cardboard for me and I'd be more than happy. Or conversely perhaps it was just a REALLY TASTY OMELET. I choose the latter but I'm not to be trusted with matters involving goat cheese.  The OJ was good fresh squeezed OJ in a mason jar (as has been noted previously).  Not like MIND-BLOWING ROCKET RIDE TO NIRVANA OJ but good.    I also ordered a side of bacon which was savory sweet and delectable. Had a certain maple-y quality to it. YUM.  The lattes were a little overly milk-i-fied but tasty nonetheless.   The only glaring omission:  ALCOHOL.  What the f*ck is a weekend breakfast/brunch without some booze?  I forgive them.  The food was tasty.  Next time I find myself down in the far southern reaches of the island on a Saturday morning I'll make a point of going back to Kitchenette.

I\'m even tempted to use the word \'rustic.\'  As anyone who follows my reviews knows I have a weakness for sweets and a weakness for breakfasts. Kitchenette won me over on both counts!

For brunch I splurged on the ""lumberjack"" -- got my egg white fix AND two out-of-this-world gingerbread pancakes with pumpkin butter. So good! Kitchenette fills its counters with homemade desserts - pies cookies you name eat - all of which looked good enough to well eat.  Warning: saw the Seamless sticker on the door as I bid adieu to Kitchenette. Does that mean I don\'t even have to leave my apartment to get milkshakes and pies? Helllllooooo obesity. Om nom nom.', 'If only you can eat the decor I would give Kitchenette 5 stars.   I come here fairly often because it\'s close to my apartment (durr waking up at 3pm on a Saturday with nothing in the fridge durr) and whenever you think ""Lets go to Kitchenette!"" my brain thinks of this fuzzy comfy cute brunch place.   The reality of it is the food is good but is not worth the price at ALL! The most recent time I paid 16 dollars for Lumberjack plate.. includes 2 blackberry cherry pancakes 2 eggs and 4 pieces of bacon. You can get a better brunch at lower price easily elsewhere in the city!   Everything on their menus is light and girly it\'s definitely a chick\'s resto. I love their strawberry butter but it tast like light butter or margarine..   Also space is tight in there! More often or not we are seating at a 4 person table with 2 strangers... they try to separate the tables but you are basically rubbing elbows with them on one side and waiter\'s butts on the other side.

The pancakes came with a small ramekin of maple syrup which helped cover up some of the dryness. For $11 I expected a larger order of pancakes as the three pancakes that I got really weren't all that filling. The coffee was okay. However the service was kind of lacking as we had to flag down the waitress both to place our orders and to get the check. For such a small dining room I can't see why service could be so inattentive.   Bottom line: the pancakes are okay but nothing to go out of your way for. I've definitely had better pancakes and service so I'd suggest trying elsewhere.""]","['Kitchenette is a cutesy little restaurant.  Something that I would picture I would see in the south or an antique store of some sort.  Came here for their brunch and we were seated almost immediately.  After having scarfed down 3 pastries from Financiere I really needed something with density to satiate my appetite.  Thank god  for Kitchenette knew exactly what I was craving.  My eyes immediately went over to the ""Protein Plate"".  Without looking at much of anything else I ordered and they delivered that protein goodness.    It came with two homemade turkey sausages four slices of bacon and scrambled eggs cooked with cheese and spinach.  I\'ve never had turkey sausage because why would I want that when I could have REAL sausage.  I will say I was right.  The turkey sausage had absolutely no fat in it and it was so healthy for you it was bad.  Flavors of the sausage were spot on but lacking the moisture content given by the fat I thought it was a pass since it was dry as could be.  They could fix this by adding some pork fat :).  Everything else on the plate was pretty standard so no complaints there.  For $13.50 I left feeling nicely satisfied with my need for meat fulfilled by kitchenette.  Kinda pricey but I guess it comes with the neighborhood.', 'I honestly expected SO MUCH MORE.  Ordered twice.   What an awful disappointment! Eggs-over-easy: smooshed into the corner of the delivery container as if the delivery guy was shaking it all the way until he reached our door.  the egg yolks were leaked out allover the RAW potatoes.  Sausage (for which they charge $3 extra was NOT THERE.  Bacon?', ""We really enjoyed the breakfast at this cute comfy cafe.  Service could have been much better but we didn't have to wait long for anything.  I had an omelette and although they forgot a few ingredients the fresh mozerrela made up for it.  No shredded cheese in my omelette... actually fresh balls of mozerella!  It was yummy.  My mom had the Protein Plate and the turkey sausage was the best we ever had.  They must have made it in house since it was not in hard casing or anything.  Super garlic flavor and ample portions.  We wish we could find this sausage in Texas.  The biscuits were homemade and tasty.  I would say the cheese grits were lacking.  Everything thing else was wonderful.  They also give you 10% off if you pay in cash so that was a plus!""]","[""This is my favorite lunch spot and not just because it's near my office. The food is great the place is super cute and everyone I ever take (usually for work-related things) is totally charmed. The omelette is especially awesome. Get it with the cheese grits."", ""3.5 Stars. Had brunch here yesterday with a friend. It's a cute decent place in Tribeca. The service is soooo friendly. I would give the service 4.5 stars. The food was good nothing spectacular although the grits were really yummy. I had the tomato artichoke and basil pesto omelette interesting combination and tasty. I will definitely go back it's a cute place in Tribeca I didn't know about. They had a ridic selection of delicious sounding shakes."", ""Sangria for breakfast? COUNT ME IN!  We tried the strawberry sangria I believe tasted like juice...which is a deadly...when you're having your first meal of the day your food hasn't come out yet and you're still drunk from the night before...didn't affect me but my friend turned BRIGHT red! :P   Why it didn't get 1 star: 1. Creme Brulee French Toast is FREAKING amazing!!!! 2. Strawberry Sangria 3. The restaurant is really cute and really well decorated perfect place to have a baby shower or something like that...but that's if you rent the whole place out because this place is TINY!   Why I didn't give it 5 stars: 1. My grits tasted EXTREMELY burnt! Like BURNT BURNT...they might have had to throw the pan they were cooking my grits with AWAY! 2. Service is a little lacking  All in all it was a cute place to visit. Probably won't be coming back...maybe for the sangria and the french toast...but everything else was either lacking or just not doing it for me...""]","['So cute I almost forgot I walked in off the streets of New York! I\'m even tempted to use the word \'rustic.\'  As anyone who follows my reviews knows I have a weakness for sweets and a weakness for breakfasts. Kitchenette won me over on both counts! The bar area has a 1950\'s soda shop style going on - and the menu has (omg) about 50 flavors of milkshakes. For brunch I splurged on the ""lumberjack"" -- got my egg white fix AND two out-of-this-world gingerbread pancakes with pumpkin butter. So good! Kitchenette fills its counters with homemade desserts - pies cookies you name eat - all of which looked good enough to well eat.  Warning: saw the Seamless sticker on the door as I bid adieu to Kitchenette. Does that mean I don\'t even have to leave my apartment to get milkshakes and pies? Helllllooooo obesity.

The reality of it is the food is good but is not worth the price at ALL!

You can get a better brunch at lower price easily elsewhere in the city!   Everything on their menus is light and girly it\'s definitely a chick\'s resto. I love their strawberry butter but it tast like light butter or margarine..   Also space is tight in there! More often or not we are seating at a 4 person table with 2 strangers... they try to separate the tables but you are basically rubbing elbows with them on one side and waiter\'s butts on the other side.

Anyhow so i ordered the spinach and brie omelet my colleagues got the pancakes and garden veg omelet. Ive had better eggs @ dennys... but they werent bad. They came wth breakfast potatoes which were really good. I wanted a bowl of fresh fruits so while ordering i asked which fruits would come with the bowl and he said - apples bananas and strawberries. The bowl actually came with banana and pears and i really hate pears. Overall  the portions were just right because we kinda filled ourselves with coffee before but if we entered starving im not sure it woulda sufficed.  We didnt stay for dessert.   Our server SUCKED. But i don't want to generalize the service based on that because we noticed that the other tables were being waited on just perfectly. We asked for water and 20 minutes later he came to check up on the table beside ours i had to ask for water again. He forgot the ketchup i asked for and i had to ask another waiter to bring some for us which he did in a jiffy.

I wanted to eat something light b/c i had lots of walking to do and didn't want a heavy stomach. The menu said $850 i was not in the mood for meat. I got my sandwich and there was a piece of chicken in it. I didn't bother telling the server that my sandwich was wrong because i'm easy going. So i (sort of) ate it.   The chicken was dry and rubbery. The bread sourdough slices were about 2.5 inches thick and cold. The fries are actually potato wedges not really fries.... I think. I ate the sandwich with no bread. the bread is super thick and didn't taste sourdough-y enough. good mozzarella and special spread.  Anyways check comes out $12.50. Oh well i didn't want chicken.   The tall white guy with some kind of european accent was super nice when refilling waters. I only drink water. So it is important that my water cup doesn't sit empty for too long.

However I figured I would review the actual food I had there.  Wings- they are on special Saturday nights so we decided to stop in.  The sauce was a bit awkward and the wings were chewy.  20 minutes after getting home (I live a block away) we both had major tummy issues.  I now associate MR wings with tummy aches.

Thursdays is dollar coors light bottles. You still can't beat that. No cover. Boom.   Plus it's never crowded for some reason which means you can have meaningful conversations about life over some light beers. Met the owner a couple times real nice guy. Place is rowdy for psu games. 4 stars for being PSU affiliated and having great specials.

Place was full of people and had lots of college age folks out there dancing.  My only problem was that in a setting like this its difficult to try to talk to people or do any sort of intros.  My ears were ringing after I left the bar (gosh do I really sound like a 65year old- yikes!).

It\'s big 2-story bar which is as many of these reviews allude to-- a frat party in every sense of the term.  You\'ll see why and how as you read on.  FIRST IMPRESSIONS: Depending on when you go the line could be anywhere from a few minutes to almost down the block (not worth the wait) obviously the later the longer.  The line is also sloppy prone to people budging in line bouncers not paying attention and oh yeah usually packed with obnoxious drunk girls smoking cigs and trying to look hotter than they really are.  Girls please try to act like a 21+ year old in line (not a 13 y/o) be like the guys and wait until you get IN to act like animals.  You get in and you will instantly be transported back to the days of greek debauchery the smell of sweat as it overpowers perfume the sticky sensation underfoot (do they actually have pledges at Mad River that they make scrub the floor after every night?  the stickiness never goes away haha!) and the soulful sounds of Journey or Sweet Caroline (more later).    THE LAYOUT: I would say this layout is one of the best suited for large groups in all of Philadelphia but that means large groups of young recent college grads not your boss and his C-level buddies (unless they are also recent college grads).  The first floor has seating along the left wall as well as bathrooms downstairs (just don\'t fall and break your neck on the stairs).  There are two bars and a giant open area in the middle for people to dance (and yes they dance there is less standing around than one might expect).  Upstairs it\'s more narrow more seating (although the few open couches are sometimes kind of soggy from drunken morons dropping drinks everywhere as if the floors weren\'t enough of an indication) and another bar.  I am pretty sure the music is the same on both floors.  THE EXPERIENCE (Drinks/Music): The drinks HAVE to be strong or else it wouldnt be such a shitshow in there every night...I myself can\'t remember how strong they were but I do kind of recall that they were priced a little higher than what would be considered reasonable for a place like that.  Then again I\'ve been at ritzy Rittenhouse clubs all winter/spring so they might be mighty cheap by comparison.  The soundtrack never changes...ever...always the same frat party music-- Journey Neil Diamond Def Leppard Belle Biv DeVoe you get the picture.  Every once in a while you\'ll hear some mainstream rap remix or something but I guess the mostly white college crowd doesn\'t go for much outside of what they can loudly sing along to.  Also as many of these reviews have stated Free Happy Hours are given out very very liberally in fact it\'s almost impossible not to get one so that\'s a plus.  THE CROWD: If ever I had more mixed emotions about a bar crowd it would certainly be about Mad River\'s.  I have had incredible times with some incredibly friendly new people who were happy to meet with my friends I was with.  I have had times when I\'ve tried to be friendly and maybe ask to dance only to be met with some of the most stuck-up and rude responses I\'ve ever heard (go back to Jersey you\'re not fooling anyone sister).  Not only that but there are about as many pleasant looking smelling and acting people as there are creepsters douchebags and ppl who just don\'t belong.  This polarization even applies to the staff-- mostly friendly bar tenders but some have had a bad night and nothing will make them be nice to you (in fact trying to be nice often results in their annoyance) and meat head bouncers.  Don\'t go there alone unless you are something really special you wont be successful in meeting anyone without a wingman/girlfriend.  THE VERDICT: Mad River is a frat party shit show it\'s filthy and the music is cliche but damn it Mad River can be a lot of fun a real adventure and a great place to enjoy a night re-experiencing those college nights when no one knew what the word ""responsibility"" meant (you might need to look it up in Webster\'s the next morning to remind yourself).  All that\'s missing is beer pong and keg stands.']","['So its Saturday night I don\'t have a whole lot going on but I decide to go out on my own relatively early... whatever right? any ways .. I finally find a place that is quite I walk in decent priced beers 3 dollars for a draft bud light not bad use to paying 2 bucks in a dive in philly. Nice atmosphere nice part of town.   But anyways I\'m just hanging out watching some college hoops drinking a beer messin around on the ol\' droid and then I feel something behind me.... I ignore it whatever some drunk idiot im guesssin then some more movement ok.... then I see an arm and a purse fly by me and hear an excuse me and its some busted looking lady... and she go\'s oh im sorry or whatever and im like its cool and I look to my left and there isn\'t a damn person there  AND ample space to order a drink  not in any ones way.so I\'m thinking ok.....   none the less I go back to my droid and I get touched again being asked if she can put her jacket on my chair and im thinking ... whatever its fine I didn\'t want any trouble. so them she sits down and starts hitting on me so I roll with it and she then persists to touch my hair and me being so use to this I\'m like sure whatever.. y\'know just pleasing my people and then back to the droid action next thing I know I am gettting strong tickles to my chin and now I am getting really irritated and I bite my tongue.  Now this is where it gets juicy so one of the nice ladies behind the bar begins to wave my attention. I see a lot of ""lip talking"" (she was trying to be quite in a realllly reallly relally loud bar / ironic enough) which I couldn\'t make out. Eventually me and her have a meeting of the minds over the bar and she ""whispers"" to me and I quote ""she\'s a dude""....  and I\'m like ""ummmm you positive?""  followed by ""yes ""she"" comes in here all the time.""    Any ways ""she"" pulled another juggler on me while I really pulled away hard and looked away while she went off on going ""OMG I cant stand egotistical men you think your out of my league ........ "" so on an so forth.    Which is when I left shortly after. Granted I wouldn\'t have done anything to begin with due to the strong fact I have morals but when the bartender shared this with me really made the whole situation funny and disturbing at the same time.  Overall  It\'s a nice spacious bar Good happy hours I just so happened to snag there specials card that runs 8-10 every evening.  Good music and good priced beers for old city.  Also I recommend finding one of your creep friends and going to old river identifying ""her"" and ordering ""her"" a drink on him and then sit back and laugh.']","['JIM H I am soooo sorry but I have to disagree!  I think this place makes for amazing comical relief.  Great top 100 music to get your drink on squished against people (and by people I mean 12 year olds...or 21 year olds who look 12 or maybe I am just old now and they are actually 21 year olds...anyway) and dance to!  Sweet Tea Vodka - Firefly to be exact Double win!  Our group actually drank the place out of the Firefly the last time we were there it was a good night.  I would like to note that they also played Party in the U.S.A. by Miley Cyrus TWICE and because I dig Hannah Montana I was happy and the boys were happy because the ladies love that ish!!  The bathrooms are up these narrow stairs which is weird but it\'s like a whole level dedicated to the powder rooms which makes for less congestion which is cool.  I have not been in the ""dance"" room we never really leave the bar side of the place.  They have a ton of TVs so you can watch scores while you are partying it up which is cool to me.    All in all I have to say this place is more of a guilty pleasure than a spot I love to go.  It is not a top choice for us but if the mood hits my peeps we stop in.  There is cover which is lame because then you have to check your coat (8 months out of the year LOL) for $2 and then buy drinks...cover is lame.    So if you are looking for somewhere to boogie not hear your friends speak and casually check sports scores while dodging 12 year olds this is your spot!!']","[""College frat party:  Sticky floors.

Barney\'s was the only place open on the block and had out door seating for the dog. Before we ordered I asked the waiter which burgers were the best. He recommended the Baja burger Western Burger and Alpine Burger. My two friends and I each ordered the three and shared a large order of spicy curley fries.   The large order of fries is actually pretty small. Although it fed all of us I could definately have finished it all by myself. It was delicious however. Its cooked to perfection and has the crunch I like. Its also seasoned very well.   Our burgers came and it was larger and higher quality than I expected. The bacon is actual large pieces of hickory smoked bacon and not the cheap thin McDonalds bacon I\'m used to. Also I like that they actually looked my burger medium rare. Many places assume we want medium and don\'t leave it red in the middle.   Overall Barney\'s delivers when they say gourmet burgers but their prices are a little steep.

The food itself was okay. For a ""gourmet"" burger place I expected more options for add-ons like fried egg and different types of sauces. When I didn\'t see that I decided to just get a classic burger medium rare with guacamole.  Sadly this place did not compare to Burger Bar. The guacamole was good but it kept squishing out and making the bun really soggy. Does anyone know why the buns aren\'t toasted?? Because that would\'ve made it so much better.  I\'m not sure if I\'d come back here to pay $10 for a burger without fries. Granted the patty itself was big and juicy (that\'s what she said! hah!.. or he.. never mind) but it really lacked flavor without the guacamole. One slice of tomato and a measly leaf of lettuce rounded out the burger which was filling but not entirely satisfying.  The spicy curly fries were the only thing that kept this place from being 2 stars; we ordered a big basket of them for our table of 5 and it wasn\'t super spicy but it definitely had a good kick to it. Yum.  If you\'re not a burger fan they have sandwiches and instead of hamburger meat patties they also have fish chicken and veggie patties for non-cow eaters. On the back I noticed milkshakes and malts with flavors like chocolate blackberry (?!).  For a big burger close by this is definitely a decent option but for something truly more ""gourmet"" than the name suggests check out one of the other bajillion joints around the city. But then you wouldn\'t get the people-watching with it.', 'Ugh so ridiculously over-rated.  Big does not always mean better. Unfortunately Barney\'s relies on their massive portions to impress customers. Maybe that would work if the food actually met a level of quality to make you desire a ton of it on your plate but it just doesn\'t. I have tried everything from the most basic to the more ""gourmet"" burgers and they\'re all a mess. Then yesterday for lunch I decided to take a walk on the wild side and try a chili cheese dog. GROSS. Why was it on a hard sourdough roll? Why were there SO many beans? Why such a strong tomato flavor? Bad bad bad.  Adding insult to injury I have never experienced good service at this location. They are friendly on 24th - but just plain surly on Steiner. Our waiter came very early to took our order and when we asked for more time he never returned...so we kept waving for help and were put off by two different people until he came back as though he\'d never been to our table before. It was so weird. And on a lazy Sunday we were lingering. Instead of politely informing us his shift was ending and he needed us to pay the bill he kept hovering and then finally just sort of pointed and grunted at the bill to indicate we needed to pay up. Amateur hour.  So why even 2 stars? The back patio is lovely and sunny. And the shakes are to die for. Sadly yesterday I enjoyed neither. My bad.']","[""Burgers were big n' juicy but not too flavorful. Asked for raw onions instead of sauteed they didn't have any. Interesting. Service was slow - but there were only two waitresses for the entire restaurant."", ""I've been to the other locations but this one was where I had my first taste of their burgers.   To be honest their burgers aren't the best I've tasted although they were at my #1 spot for a long time until I ventured around the city more. But what I like about Barney's is the overall meal.   Their burgers are good and they have a great selection. You can easily satisfy any cravings with all the varieties they offer. So that's a plus if you like to try different combinations.   Their Curly Fries and Onion Rings are crave-worthy! I sometimes want to come here just for the those deep fried sides.   They have creamy milkshakes and they don't skimp on the portions. You get your glass plus everything else in those silver mix cups. (which most of the time is perfect for sharing!)   Those 3 factors make up for a well-rounded meal and it is what really gets me coming back...."", ""So many mouth watering choices. I was stuck choosing between the mushroom burger or the tomato pesto. I finally went with the tomato pesto. It so super yummy. . It had spinach peppers and of course pesto. I was barley able to have a conversation during dinner because it was so delectable. Also the sweet potato fries were delicious too. . This place deserves five stars and besides it's named after my cat.""]","['I took a break on Sunday to go to one of my favorite unpretentious burger restaurants in the Bay Area: Barney\'s. I first discovered it in Berkeley and it has long been a go-to whenever I\'m craving a burger. In addition to a huge selection of burgers Barney\'s is known for their amazingly thick milkshakes and family-friendly atmosphere.  The Burger: Barney\'s offers over 20 different burgers and their toppings are definitely what set them apart. From the ""Caribbean Burger"" with zucchini bell pepper and carrots with home-style Caribbean jerk sauce to the ""Popeye Burger"" topped with spinach garlic and feta cheese Barney\'s offers something for everyone\'s taste buds. I have only one criticism: all these toppings are delicious but mask a less than remarkable patty which on its own is not as flavorful.  The Fries: In addition to their traditional skinny and steak cut fries Barney\'s is known for their curly fries served with zesty ranch dressing. I like that they serve them slightly before the burgers come out of the kitchen to allow you to give the fries your full attention!  The Ambiance: In my opinion Barney\'s is the most family-friendly and laid back of the restaurants I\'ve reviewed thus far. It\'s not fancy schmancy but it\'s got a great menu and decent service.

The large order of fries is actually pretty small. Although it fed all of us I could definately have finished it all by myself. It was delicious however. Its cooked to perfection and has the crunch I like. Its also seasoned very well.   Our burgers came and it was larger and higher quality than I expected. The bacon is actual large pieces of hickory smoked bacon and not the cheap thin McDonalds bacon I\'m used to. Also I like that they actually looked my burger medium rare.

The restaurant is a nice place to sit with good tables and chairs complementing a very courteous and nice staff. The beer selection is pretty good and the range of condiments a good mix (Pepper grinders! Yay!)  So when it came to ordering my burger I had to choose between going fancy and going what I know I will like. I went with fancy at this place got a California burger that featured bacon Ortega chilies and sour cream. Now I thought this combo would be a hit but really it just seemed like only one of the flavors would pop out at you at a time which isn\'t really ideal. In this case it was usually the bread or the meat dominating the flavor and you couldn\'t really taste the chilies or bacon and when you did it was kinda ho hum. This was also odd because the slice of bacon was the thickest I have ever seen see pics. The flavor overall left you saying ""Really? That\'s what you are offering? That\'s what you are bringing to the table?""  The burger wasn\'t the best ever kinda dry and the bread really played of that in a bad way and gave you a kinda semi good home made burger with old dry bread as a bun flavor. Very very chewy is how I would describe it but a little light on flavor.  The fries tho excellent. The sweet potato fries were also very good and that\'s coming from someone who doesn\'t care for them so therefore they should be just amazing to people who do. Also my dad\'s burger looked delicious he went the simple rout and ordered a French burger that was very nice.   I saw enough potential in this place to want to go back and try again.

The bf had spent some time in and around NYU awhile back and was convinced in taking me to West Village for dinner.  After wandering around for awhile we came across Home.  Perused their menu from the outside walked up and down the street and settled on stopping in for dinner.  Had their ""Bubbly Saint"" drink for starters and loved it.  I\'m a huge fan of St. Germaine so it was going to be a win regardless.  The boyfriend went for their ""Apple in the Rye"" and it was also delicious (coming from someone that doesn\'t like whiskey).    Main courses were the Butternut Squash ravioli and the burger.  I selected the ravioli and was surprised that there was next to no presentation of the dish when it came out.  About 6 ravioli swimming in the cream sauce...literally swimming.  In regards to taste the sauce was better than the ravioli itself which sort of made up for the situation.  The burger was OK can\'t say that it blew me away but the french fries were astounding!  Service was mediocre felt like we were being rushed a little bit.  What\'s the hurry on a Thursday night?  Overall it was OK but if I were in West Village again I\'d probably entertain trying somewhere new first.', ""Home is a lovely place.  It's not much bigger than the West Village apartment I once inhabited around the block but once you wedge yourself in the experience is quite cozy.  The staff helpfully stowed our coats out of the way as the tables are pretty tight.

Luckily we were in the mood for a languorous lunch and the food was worth the wait.  The Cobb salad is enormous and the hand-battered fried chicken on top was light crisp and quite tender.  Decadent but since there was not a heavy fry on the chicken it still felt like a (relatively) healthy entree.  I've had many a plate of mac 'n cheese in NYC but Home's is on point.  It arrives in a hot cast iron skillet with the top layer of cheese still bubbling and browned.  The sauce below is light but still plenty rich...and add the multicolored heirloom tomatoes and slab bacon to the dish for a real treat.  I was ravenous and only made it through half of the large.  We ended our meal with homemade hot chocolate with brandy and fresh whipped cream - a perfectly simple dessert drink.  I would recommend this spot to catch up with an old friend or perhaps for a third or fourth date...as you will have plenty of time to chat during your delish meal."", 'I\'d heard really wonderful things about Home which happens to be conveniently located around the corner from my apartment.

Home Sweet Home."", ""Whenever I feel that a restaurant earns 3.5 stars I'm usually generous and bump it up to 4.  But for some reason I can't bring myself to do it for Home.  Don't get me wrong I had a very nice meal here but I just felt like something was missing or a bit off.  As others have noted it is incredibly cozy and narrow inside.  It does give off that homey comfy vibe.  Unfortunately I didn't feel incredibly welcomed when we walked in.  The hostess seemed pretty out of it and at times confused - perhaps she was just having a bad day?  But I expect a little energy and pep from a hostess especially when it's at a place that lends itself to a friendly and relaxed environment.  The other waitstaff was fine but since we sat right across from the tiny bar the hostess' vibe kept encroaching on ours.  But of course the thing that matters most when dining out is the food.  My friend and I started with the duck empanadas appetizer (although I was very tempted to try their fried green tomatoes even though I didn't understand how that could cost $2 *more* than the duck).  Considering I had just eaten a wonderful (and cheap) meal at Empanada Mama a few nights prior I was kind of disappointed.  The duck was on the dry side and I felt that the crust was also dry and too flakey.  The accompanying hot sauce didn't really do much for me either.  My main course was the saffron parpadelle with scallops and green beans.  This dish was actually very tasty.  I got three huge scallops served atop the creamy pasta.  I don't think I really tasted the saffron but maybe I just don't know what saffron on creamy pasta should taste like.  Unfortunately I had a couple bites of grit with my scallops but that didn't really take away from the fact that they were so succulent and perfectly seared.  My friend ordered the pork chop with onion rings and sauteed carrots.  Those carrots were really tasty!  Very sweet and fresh.  The pork chop was nice and flavorful (not to mention HUGE) and the onion rings had a nice crunch to them.  Even though we had more than enough food we decided to go-for-broke and order a small dish of mac &amp; cheese (cuz that's how we do).  I later regretted this move since my sensitive tummy can only handle so much creaminess in one meal.  I thought the mac &amp; cheese was good but not the best I've had in the city (I much prefer Westville's).  We were much too stuffed to have dessert.  Even though we looked at the dessert menu none of it registered b/c my brain was no longer functioning due to the food overload.  In the end I'm not sure if I'd return to Home.  Given that it's literally right next door to Pearl Oyster Bar (one of my fave restaurants in all of NYC) I'd be hard-pressed to choose Home over Pearl if I'm in the neighborhood.  The experience was enjoyable and the food was good but there just wasn't that extra little something that would keep me coming back to Home.""]","['Came for late brunch on the first day that felt like spring and wasn\'t at the same time as the NCAA tournament.

Home exemplifies what I love about great neighborhood restaurants in New York.  I wish I could click my ruby slippers together and transport this wonderful place to San Francisco because I would go there all of the time.  I\'ve been coming here for over 10 years and it never fails to deliver a perfect seasonal fresh and satisfying meal.  Cornelia Street (off of West 4th and 6th Ave) is a quiet street in the West Village full of charm so is the perfect home for Home.  The restaurant is narrow and cozy with a wonderful outdoor garden for dining on summer nights.  The decor is welcoming and charming with a tin ceiling and warm lighting.  It\'s not overly decorated and the muted whitewashed colors give it a somewhat Danish country feel.  Upon arriving in Manhattan on a brisk December evening my co-worker and I were in need of a well-cooked substantial meal.  We heading down to Home and were immediately enveloped in the warmth and comfort of the place. We started with a lovely warm apple cider &amp; bourbon which further added to the mood.  Service is personal professional and friendly and the server had good recommendations which I love.  All of the ingredients are local which is so great.  You can read further about their suppliers on their website  http://www.recipesfrom... / It\'s like someone went to the Farmer\'s market and prepared a meal using the best found items.  To start we ordered their famous Onion Rings with home-made ketchup which is a standard favorite of mine.  The order is huge which I had forgotten.  The ketchup is great and has a savory kick like cinnamon or curry. They also offer a decadently rich bleu cheese dip with chive oil sprinkled on top.  Mmmmm.  We also split the goat cheese salad with grilled apples onions and toasted cashews.  Yummmmm.  For my entree I had the seared duck with cinnamon - so divine.  Rich moist flavorful duck that melted in your mouth.  It came with a potato gratin which was creamy and rich.  My dining companion had the roasted game hen with vegetables - and she loved it.  They always do poultry well here - perfectly cooked great seasoning and the vegetables (turnips I think) were a nice accompaniment.  As if all of that weren\'t enough I also ordered a small side of the mac &amp; cheese with ""overnight"" tomatoes.  So good.  I actually wish there were more tomatoes as they lend a great flavor and cut the richness of the dish so well.  OK dessert.  They have great desserts at Home and you should try not to be a glutton like myself and stuff yourself silly before dessert.  I really wanted the bread pudding or the chocolate pudding or the apple/cherry pie....but I thought I would literally explode.  So we split the 3 scoops of ice cream and WOW what a great choice.  1 scoop of impossibly creamy vanilla 1 scoop of rich chocolate chocolate chip and the best one?  A green apple sorbet that was heavenly like biting into a fresh green apple.  They get it from a Manhattan supplier (I forget who) and the taste is excellent.    What more can I say to convince you to try this gem of a restaurant?  The prices are reasonable (all of that for under $100 for two) the food is delicious the service is friendly and the atmosphere is lovely.  It\'s great for a date or for catching up with a friend or when you are in need of some gastronomic TLC as is often the case with me.  I have recommended it many times to friends and no one has ever been disappointed.  When I am feeling the distance of miles separating me from my city and loved ones it\'s always nice to know that I can have a little taste of Home :)']","[""ate here over a year ago just found the business card in my drawer  i remember what i ate here that speaks volumes  duck breast with cinnamon  mushroom spaetzle  it was so good  this might've even been before i yelped"", ""I'm kind of in love with this place. It does feel like you are eating in someone's home.   Home is a little gem of a restaurant. It's small intimate and super romantic. There is a real rustic feel to this restaurant... it is comfortable but still elegant. It is a great place for a quiet dinner with friends or a romantic date. But be warned -  you'll end up eating delicious hearty foods here... so leave the tight dress at home.   We were in a party of four and started in the back patio for cocktails. The patio is a lot more casual - I recommend it for a larger group. I could see throwing a fun dinner party here.   Anyway... we moved inside for dinner. We started with the blue cheese fondue which as served with crostinis green apple slices and salami. We devoured it.   We also tried the crabcakes... they were pretty small but very good.   For the main course I had their braised beef shank. It was very heavily marbled flavorful and hearty. This is the dish you crave on a cold winter night. It was cooked perfectly and just fell off the bone. They were served with addicting mashed potatoes. They were so good I kept eating them even though I was full.   Benji had the lamb chops. It was excellent. Our friends had two different kinds of mac and cheese - chicken and bacon. How could you go wrong there right??  So for dessert they brought out a mug of their chocolate pudding. It was pretty incredible. Like lick the mug incredible.   Grab a cookie on the way out. Or on the way in like I did. ;)"", ""what a cute little place!  very intimate and cosy if you're looking for such a place.  i went with a friend for the food (i swear!) on the recommendation of another friend.  why do you care about that?  you don't i'm not even sure why i included that.  just know that you've been warned--it's romantic so at least you know not to plan a breakup dinner date there.      anyways let's get to the nitty gritty.  the food.  is. delicious.  we got the duck confit salad with watercress and these amazing vanilla infused pan seared scallops that were absolutely delectable.  there was a tasty cocktail involved that involved sparkling wine mixed with elderberry liquor and mostly tasted like juice.  the two red wines my friend sampled were sort of subpar and very tannin-y--pass on those.  i know i'm all out of order here but while i'm sort of haphazardly reviewing everything their bread basket was tasty and the olive oil they provided for dipping was very fruity and delicious.   on to the main!  we got the short ribs obviously because short ribs are delicious and fatty and amazing.  i wish my arteries could handle eating them more often.  however they were served with fried maitake mushrooms on this bed of creamy something or another which was also... you guessed it! amazing!  we also ordered a side of market greens which were brussel sprouts simply sauteed in something that suspiciously tasted like butter.  no complaints there.    and dessert.  it was my birthday of COURSE we had to get dessert.  we ended up going with the banana chocolate bread pudding also with ice cream on top (had to do it right you know?) which was crusty and smushy in all the right places.    the only thing i sort of didn't enjoy was the assault of the ass (haha get it? ASSault!) because the tables were SO CLOSE TOGETHER.  it was like i couldn't get away from the asses--i turned around to get my bag and there was the ass in my face of a lady who was going to the bathroom.  my dining buddy was threatened with an ass-ident of a lady who looked like she wanted to exit via the 4 inch space between our tables (sorry sweetheart not going to happen unless you are anorexic barbie) but changed her mind and went the other more spacious direction.    at any rate the food was delicious.  the ambience appropriate for a date or two very comfortable friends.  the space--not very plentiful but as long as you are okay with your personal space being invaded by the derrière it's tolerable.""]","['Decent food less than decent service.  Everything about Home is very home-like from the narrow dining room to the little bar to the decor and feel of the place. The food is homey as well... comforting but not very impressive or interesting at all.  Came here on a Saturday for brunch. The place was pretty full but we were able to grab a small table by the door. After we sat down we literally waited 15 minutes for someone to take our order. I say someone because I was beyond confused as to who our waitress was... there seemed to be just one waitress serving the entire place and one bartender who was just chilling behind the bar for the longest time. The finally realizing that they were understaffed the bartender came out from behind the bar and went to some random table in the back to take their order. However these two people just continued to pass our table without really acknowledging us or attempting to take our order.  Finally the bartender came over and asked if we would like anything to drink to which I quickly replied that we were actually ready to order our food. I got the scrambled eggs with leeks and spinach while the bf got the cheddar-bacon grits with poached eggs.   The strange thing is... it probably only took 5 minutes for our food to come out. Never have I ever experienced a meal where the entire wait time to order took 3 times as long as food prep. Anyway the food we received was satisfactory definitely very homey. In fact I definitely could have made that egg scramble at home.   We checked out their dessert menu again very homey dessert offerings. Nothing really jumped out so we decided to forgo dessert. Just as we were purveying the dessert menu the waitress came over and put down a basket of mini corn muffins. Strange... aren\'t they supposed to serve the bread before our meal and not when we\'re on our way out? Since we didn\'t order dessert I tried one of the corn muffins... pretty good albeit cold.   I think I would have enjoyed brunch here more if it weren\'t for the bizarre service. Maybe they\'re letting the concept of ""Home"" getting to them a little too much this is a restaurant establishment afterall... please institute some organization and proper service maybe start with assigning sections to your waitstaff.', 'I cant imagine how anyone can rate Home lower than 4 stars - and even that feels a little too low. I visited Home a few days ago with a few colleagues and clients and had a fabulous meal. What I loved about Home was that the food was great without bordering on pretentious. Being from Norther California I have become accustomed to the concept of locally grown organic and impeccably sourced ingredients - while this is not rare in the San Francisco bay area it seems non-existent in most of New York and the rest of the country.   Additionally the concept seems solid - home food done really well. It was a welcome change to have a great plate of Macaroni and Cheese a wonderful trout on a bed of lentils  a great Sonoma County wine (Ro Sham Bo) and for desert - chocolate pudding to die for.   To top it of I was comfortable and so were my guests. Over the years I have tired of the large ""it"" place of the moment I enjoy a small intimate restaurant where I can hear the conversation enjoy my food and enjoy a great night out. I will be back.', ""Home has a quiet and charming New England dining room as well as an oasis of a back patio that is shaded by trees. Either dining environment transports you from the city as does the brunch which begins with addicting corn bread. Whether you follow that with a light and fluffy zucchini squash and goat cheese omelet or a delicately compiled burger with deep fried onion rings and homemade ketchup you won't have a disappointing bite. Between the cozy quarters the relaxed service the ever changing menu and artful dish composition you always feel like what you ate was made just for you. You can find a brunch for less but the value is unbeatable.   I don't recommend dinner as strongly - somewhat sleepy and overpriced.   My only qualm with Home is that sometimes it's too quiet - a little music would help.""]","['home', 'home', 'home']","['pork', 'pork', 'onion sauce']","['heirloom', 'steak', 'steak']","['day', 'day', 'day']","['green', 'green', 'green']","['blue cheese', 'blue cheese', 'blue cheese']","['cake', 'hen', 'game']","['farm', 'farm', 'cheese salad']","['mushroom', 'mash', 'mushroom']","['corn', 'trout', 'corn']"

My skinny jeans hate you.   I'm an NYU graduate student which is a weird position to be in. I'm 30 not 18 I've lived all over the place and the majority of restaurants aimed at NYU students leave me totally cold and frankly kind of irritated most of the time. You try spending the majority of your time around loud drunk  undergrads and see how you like it. Anyway Crumbs has been open about six months and caters to surprise the NYU crowd. The location is large and in the strip-mall of 8th avenue next to where Girlprops used to be near such unique New York gems as Subway Johnny Rocket and Dashing Diva nail salon.   Inside there's a long counter along the right wall seating up front in the window and an airy back room with no windows. A few lone cupcake-eating laptoppers were staking out the joint yesterday. I don't know if they have wireless. They have a HUGE selection of cupcakes mini ones huge ones and a ton of other mysterious looking pastries (I think mostly ruggelah and cookies). Overwhelmed I asked the laconic counter girl what cupcake they were known for and she recommended the Oreo but I really think I should've gone with the carrot.. anyway. I got the Oreo ($3.50) and an iced coffee for about $5.   The Oreo is a marvel of cupcake engineering and requires a fork or a very large mouth to eat. The frosting was about two inches thick and not that good. The entire Oreo on the top was kind of soggy. But the chocolate cupcake was yum yum moist and not dry. I find Magnolia's cupcakes super dry and crumbly. The coffee was good too.   I feel like I will have to go back and try the buttercream and carrot cake cupcakes to really make an informed decision. If you're reading this you can't really lose by going and at least trying their cupcakes; I mean it's $4 not $100 and you can't gain ten pounds overnight from eating cupcakes.

I was out on a sunny afternoon in the winter and thought we should start up again just you and I and not listen to what anyone has to say about how we're wrong for each other.  I walked in purchased a red velvet cupcake and a Reese's (tm?) cupcake.  I brought you home put you in a bowl and proceeded to eat you up.  The red velvet was a complete disappointment was that buttercream frosting?  I think it's illegal to use buttercream on red velvet as the appropriate frosting is cream cheese.  If it was a cream cheese frosting I think you forgot the cream cheese.  The Reese's (tm?) was equally disappointing.  What was the deal with the greasy film on my teeth after eating a fork full of the icing that's unusual and kinda gross.

I give this place an average of 4 stars 3 for the cake (kinda dry) and 5 for the frosting + random cupcake fillings (see above about the sugar coma).  I think I've tried most of their flavors -- the ones that spring to mind immediately are S'Mores Cookie Dough Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Chocolate Buttercream and Red Velvet.  If you're a cupcake newbie try the S'Mores.  It's a chocolate cupcake iced with chocolate frosting there are marshmallows mixed in with the frosting and marshmallow fluff injected into the middle of the cupcake.  They're $3.50 each and pretty big so you could split them and avoid the sugar coma.  But I'm just one for the suffering.""]","[""There's no way these cupcakes are only 500-600 calories. They also made me broke last night which I'm a little angry about since we bought 6 and it came out to ~$22 dollars. I would've much rather gone to Sugar Sweet Sunshine on the LES if I had time...  However I do applaud the wonderful lady behind the counter who helped us fit 6 monstrous cupcakes in a way that it could secretly go into a purse so that the birthday girl would not know that we had some goodies hiding."", ""This location has seating and opens late for patrons who need a happy ending from working the late closing shift like myself.

Overwhelming in a good sense though...like a cream pie to the face and your nose and mouth and tongue just don't know how to react to what's going on.  Crumbs specializes in specific cupcake flavors. Like Snickers or Reeses or Cookie Dough. They also have the always loved chocolate and vanilla and their to-die-for Red Velvet. The minis I've had at birthday parties are pretty good - bit size. The Red Velvet I had today was unbelievable good and I'm not really a huge red velvet girl. The cream cheese frosting is decadent and the red cupcake so moist. There's also enough frosting to go around. I'm always disappointed when all my cupcake bites aren't dabbled with frosting. So glad I went for it. Although I honestly chose the red because it was one of the only medium-sized cupcakes besides chocolate and vanilla. They need to have more! Everything else was big and at $4 a cupcake!   5 stars for really really great little pieces of heaven bumped down to a 4 for a bit of an outrageous price for a cupcake.   Great location too. I love 8th St. So easy to take a quick break from shoe shopping to grab a little cake.""]","[""This location has seating and opens late for patrons who need a happy ending from working the late closing shift like myself.

This place is the McDonald's of cupcakes in my opinion. They're everywhere in NYC.  I went there with my friend. The staff was friendly and they have a variety of large cupcakes. It's not so so pricey compared to other cupcake shops and you get a lot in one cupcake. A lot of their cupcakes have fillings. I had the chocolate covered strawberry  which was was pretty delicious. Chocolate cake with strawberry filling (which was a surprise because I wasn't expecting filling). I think my friend had the red velvet cupcake which was also yummy.   I haven't gone back yet but I might one day. There are just way too many smaller businesses I want to try out. I liked my Crumbs experience but it's still the McDonald's of cupcake shops to me."", ""Mmm cupcakes are my absolute favorite and Crumbs has some of the BEST around!  The strawberry and Reese's ones are my favorite but I like to try new ones whenever I go because you really can't go wrong here. They are pricey at around $4 each but quite large. You can easily split one between two people for a tasty dessert or heck eat one by yourself as a meal!""]","['Never before have I tried such deliciousness in a cupcake. Our visit to crumbs was perfect. The place is clean the staff is courteous and they have tables to rest. A perfect stop when in the city and you just want to unwind a bit. Besides cupakes they also have coffee and leomonade. Since you are looking at a high intake of calories this is one of those places you go for a special treat on occassions. This is the size of cupcake that you dig in with a spoon. You may even want to share a cupcake with a friend or two.  So sit around with your friends and dig up.   Only one thing that was hillarious and a bit unexpected from this last visit. That was that they now have a cupcake (not sure how long they have had it) called ""Baba Booey"". I have a few trucker friends and I know that ""Baba Booey"" is the advertising call and nickname for gay drivers on the CB radio used by truckers to communicate with one another. So it was crazy for me to have seen that they actually have one of their products by this name.    I had a ""Raspberry Swirl"" it has the tasty raspberry jelly in the middle of a moist vanilla cake. This one is not too overwhelming in sweetness.  ""Caramel Apple"" is another one of my favorite. It has chunks of apple filling which makes this cupcake so rich and tasty. This one is very sweet.  My little one picked up a ""S\'Mores"". It is rich in chocolate and it was a bit too much for him. A very busy chocolate cupcake topped with marshmellows and graham crackers over chocolate frosting. I will deffinitely stick to the little cupcakes for children.   I am thinking of returning to try a ""Margarita"" which is the cupcake of this month. I wonder what surprise is in the middle.', ""When it comes to cupcakes Crumbs is undoubtedly the best in it's class. Favorites are yummy Caramel Apple (contains real pieces of apple) Red Velvet and the Oreo cupcake. A little pricey spot but cupcakes are really superior and worth the price. You just HAVE to eat it ! Really delicious and well crafted cupcakes."", 'If you love cupcakes but you always want to eat more than just one then Crumbs is the place to go! Their cupcakes are massive (they do offer ""mini"" cupcakes but why would someone want one that small) and they have a huge variety. They also offer a large selection of other desserts such as cookies brownies and cakes but they are famous for their cupcakes.   One of my favorite things about Crumbs cupcakes are the toppings such as pieces of candy extra sprinkles and chunks of cookies! It might sound like an overload but once you start eating them you wont be able to stop. Prepare yourself for a sugar high...but it\'s oh so worth it. If you go with friends you should definitely order a couple and share them so that you don\'t have to choose just one!   Favorites: Raspberry swirl cupcake hostess cupcake reese\'s cupcake caramel apple cupcake']","[""Crumbs is good unfortunately a bit expensive. The cupcakes are huge though so one is enough. The cupcakes are a hit or miss. Some of them are AMAZING like the blackout and the carrot cake. Others like the one with reece's cups on top are not very good. The hot chocolate is bland and expensive. But their cupcakes are absolutely adorable how can I resist?"", ""So...I love cupcakes and Crumbs is my second favorite place to buy them (favorite is in Boston at Sweet I think the flavors are more creative).  I came here for breakfast (I already say I love cupcakes don't judge) and got the Apple Cobbler which was fantastic. The frosting was perfect for a 'cobbler' cupcake the cupcake was moist the chunks of apple in the jelly in the middle and top were the perfect size and there was the perfect amount of the jelly. I wanted another but I didn't want those calories...I wanted to get the Blackout one so bad too!"", 'Favorite place ever the guy at the counter was so helpful and he memorized all of the different cupcakes that we have asked him to tell us about.

For the life of me I can't remember what it was called but it featured peppered turkey and gouda cheese. And it was incredible.

Already a bad sign but we were like hey why don't we give it a try?  Oh and the people who own this place are Chinese not Korean not that really matters.  Some really good cheap sushi places that serve quality food are owned by Chinese people.  Anyway.  So we sit down and ask for some tea.  We are told no tea only water and soda.  A little odd for a Japanese restaurant but oh well.  We then proceed to order the dinner box special in which you get to choose two different items (like chicken teriyaki salmon teriyaki sushi sashimi etc.) and then also get some soup and a bunch of sides.  After we order the waitress comes back quite apologetic saying that the pork tonkatsu that we want is not available because they have no pork tonight so would chicken be okay?  Um slightly weirder.  No pork at all?  Okay fine some of us order chicken instead but one of my friends decides to change to beef teriyaki.  Sorry no beef either. Umm..fine how about tuna teriyaki?  No tuna either.

But then as we're eating one of my friends sitting across from me starts freaking out 'cause there's a large cockroach on the wall behind me.  I try to kill it in a somewhat inconspicuous manner but the thing evades me and we start to become rather noticeable with us swatting at the walls and stomping on the floors in an effort to destroy the unkillable insect.  All this time the owners and staff are looking on in a somewhat amused and apologetic manner though they do not step in to do anything.

However to flesh out the experience for you I would like to describe what actually happened when me and a couple of friends went there last week.   So we were actually planning on going to Morandi the Italian place right nearby that's supposed to be pretty good.  However the one friend who wanted to go there got sick so we figured why don't we try something else and go to Morandi when she's feeling better?  Oh such a bad idea.   One of my friends had a craving for sushi so we walked into the closest sushi place from Morandi and just our luck it turned out to be Sawa Sushi.  First thing we notice nobody in the restaurant.  Already a bad sign but we were like hey why don't we give it a try?  Oh and the people who own this place are Chinese not Korean not that really matters.  Some really good cheap sushi places that serve quality food are owned by Chinese people.  Anyway.  So we sit down and ask for some tea.  We are told no tea only water and soda.  A little odd for a Japanese restaurant but oh well.  We then proceed to order the dinner box special in which you get to choose two different items (like chicken teriyaki salmon teriyaki sushi sashimi etc.) and then also get some soup and a bunch of sides.  After we order the waitress comes back quite apologetic saying that the pork tonkatsu that we want is not available because they have no pork tonight so would chicken be okay?  Um slightly weirder.  No pork at all?  Okay fine some of us order chicken instead but one of my friends decides to change to beef teriyaki.  Sorry no beef either. Umm..fine how about tuna teriyaki?  No tuna either.  So basically most of the items on the menu are not available.  At this point  we are actually sort of amused because of the ridiculousness of the situation so we just order whatever we can and sit and wait.  Food comes bland not great but not terrible either.  Though the sushi does taste a little not fresh it's not the worst thing I've ever eaten.  But then as we're eating one of my friends sitting across from me starts freaking out 'cause there's a large cockroach on the wall behind me.  I try to kill it in a somewhat inconspicuous manner but the thing evades me and we start to become rather noticeable with us swatting at the walls and stomping on the floors in an effort to destroy the unkillable insect.

Geez! Anyway we came here last night for the Cochon 555 after-party and it was a blast! I had no idea that this place was inspired by Marvin Gaye's two year self-imposed exile in Belgium until someone told me about it but hey I would have enjoyed myself anyway.  First of all the upstairs bar/ lounge area is a marvel of modern architecture. Dark maple high ceilings and a classic wooden bar help to provide a very welcoming classy and hip atmosphere. (This would be another great place for a date as long as you come in the early evening. More on that later.) The best part about it is that the back of the lounge literally opens up into the night. I wouldn't have even known I was on a rooftop if I hadn't walked back there to get a little peace and quiet to answer a phone call. Lean over the rail and you can take in the warm early spring air while enjoying a nice little view of Shaw. The downside is that smoking is allowed here so you do run the risk of having emphysema-scented hair at the end of the evening.  Naturally a place inspired by Marvin Gaye and Belgium is gonna have a nice supply of booze. I was particularly intrigued by the ass-load of quality beer that they carry. From what I could tell they only had 5 or 6 beers on tap but they were all excellent ones (Delerium Tremens Hoegaarden and Leffe among others). The bottled beers are the bread and butter here though. Among others I noted Delerium Tremens (can't have too much of a good thing) Hennepin Chimay Golden Monkey and Allagash. My memory stops there; once I settled on DT that was it.  The packed crowd was electric not the least of which was due to the presence of scores of Cochon 555 chefs assistants staff members and guests. The Thievery Corporation soundtrack certainly didn't hurt either. People seemed generally cool here despite what some of the earlier reviews say. I never felt like I was in some kind of testosterone-filled Wild Wild West where even the most innocent glance at some dude's ugly girlfriend will get you in a fight. I refuse to patron such places. Marvin's attracts a more passive breed of clientele. I walked up to some strange kid with a beautiful head of flowing curls and just started petting it with the concentration of an undergrad on adderall and ecstasy. The kid calmly accepted my weird impulsive decision and frankly I think he might have liked it. That's the kind of guy I want to be around when I make a drunken ass of myself.  As hoppin' as this place was on a Sunday night I can't even imagine what it must be like on a Friday or Saturday. You probably wouldn't be able to move. Either way I look forward to returning to Marvin soon and I hope curly fro guy does too."", ""Marvin is located at the corner of 14th and U.  Unassuming and modest from the outside this restaurant downstairs and lounge upstairs has a great vibe.  Upstairs a dj spins soul/funk which gives the upstairs a great groove for people to mingle and meet.  There's an outside deck with bar that gives the upstairs a fair capacity.  I wish I could have come for dinner but I spent the evening upstairs hanging out.  Next time I'll be sure to sample the food.""]","[""I'm surprised the reviews aren't better for Marvin. Yes it's crowded and it takes a while to get your food; but if you make a reservation and order a beer it's no big deal to wait for something good. And the food at Marvin is great.   I've been more times than I can count we often stop here before seeing a show at the 9:30 club. Parking isn't easy; but I've always found a spot on the road.   We should probably branch out; but we usually order a combination of our favorites: the scallop appetizer some mussels the shrimp and grits (appy for my meal) and fried chicken and waffles (my husband's meal). We've never been disappointed. It's truly one of our go-to restaurants in DC and one we take our out-of-town guests.  The rooftop bar is fun in the summer and even in the cold months they have space heaters."", ""The more I go to Marvin the more I like it.  I've been for drinks on Sunday &amp; Monday; dinner on Monday; late night on Friday &amp; Saturday.    The drinks are strong and reasonably priced so yay!  I love the partially-enclosed heated patio.  Marvin is a chill place - no need to get dressed up and fairly empty early in the evening.  It is also fairly empty on Sundays but on Mondays the crowd starts to pick-up around 9:30 and old-school hip-hop is the music of choice.  Late night Friday/Saturday does not impress - the few times I've been the music has been lame and crowd was not my style.  This is not a dance spot.  Bathrooms are clean and warm.  I loved dinner.  While I thought the service was off (though the hostess rocked) the food was great.  I had chicken and waffles mainly because I've never had that and it always sounds delicious which it was.  A huge piece of fried chicken is served over a square waffle with collard greens and gravy underneath.  The chicken was juicy and tender with the perfect amount of crispiness.  Gravy added a nice flavor to the greens and though I prefer a crispier waffle everything worked.    I have no need to go back late night but cannot wait to return for dinner or even just to grab a drink with a friend."", ""One of the best meals had in DC by far.  Do not drive into the area take metro because you will never find parking in this area (speaking for the weekends) Marvin gets really busy on the weekends reservations are a must. The 1 st time my bf tried dining here we couldn't find parking and eventually got frustrated and left. Last night our 2 friends didn't find parking till 45 mins later. We had to wait at the bar because they will not seat incomplete parties.   Nonetheless the food is definitely worth the wait. The theme is interesting. Its a mixture between a belgian dark lit cafe with the soulfulness of Marvin Gaye himself. My party shared the shrimp and grits mushroom tartine and bbq ribs appetizers. I haven't tried a lot of grits before but this one was spectacular. It was creamy and cheesey. Mushroom tartine was a must because of the poached egg and mushroom- 2 of my fav ingredients the grilled country bread soaked up the runny yolk and mushroom juices very well. Bbq ribs were decent fall off the bone meaty and the sauce was finger licking good. Bf and I shared the chicken and waffle which was a portioned just right for us because with appetizers and shared entree we were certainly full. That CHICKEN was AMAZING. One of the best fried chickens I have tried. Super crispy and tender on the inside. Waffle was ok; was a bit on the soggy side. I prefer my waffles toasty and somewhat crunchy exterior.   Ended dinner with warm toffee cake which our table of 4 shared. Soo good. The cake had a consistency almost like a carrot cake thick and meaty. The salted caramel ice cream on top was really the cherry on top of the entire meal.""]","[""Great rooftop bar excellent dj truly excellent.   A great array of Belgian beers on tap and the decor's cool with a diverse and good-looking crowd.   Sweet potato fries are a plus.  I'm also a sucker for a place that serves shrimp and grits though I didn't get to try them.  Next time.  The neighborhood reminds me of St. Marks in the East Village when it was on its way to gentrification but was still interesting because it hadn't gotten there yet."", ""I'm surprised the reviews aren't better for Marvin.

I loved the vibe of the place - it truly captured the soul of Marvin Gaye's music: dim lighting candles intimate seating. I went here for a date Friday night and it was perfect.   I ordered a glass of the Rose and had the Sweet Potato Agnoletti for my entree selection. The guy I was with ordered the Moules Frites (Mussels for all you non-French people!). We were both impressed with the decent portion size (not HUGE but not microscopic) and price. Last but not least we had the Toffee Cake and Salted Caramel Ice Cream for dessert. I am a huge chocolate fan so was initially looking at the gateau chocolat but the waitress convinced us to order this one and was glad she did. She said this was their best - selling dessert. After one bite I swore I would return for this dessert alone.  Definitely coming back here with my mom for brunch."", ""I love this place!  I would give this 4.5 stars if I could.  They market themselves as Belgian Soul Food which is an interesting combo but it works for them.  I was having difficulty deciding between their famous Chicken and Waffles and their Red Curry Moules Frites (Mussles and Fries).  I ended up with the Moules Frites which was definitely the right choice.  A large bowl of mussles came out swimming in a savory red curry sauce.  I thought that was it at first but then the waiter brought out a huge funnel of fries with three dipping sauces.  I ended up soaking the fries in the curry and eating it with the mussles.  It's usually rare for me to actually work hard to finish all my food but I did it and I was in a happy/full state of mind afterwards--maybe because I helped my friend finish some of her chicken and waffles and the pinot noir we ordered.  You have to be willing to spend some money when you go here though--the dishes are around $17 each but it is worth it to try it at least once.  On a different note I went to Marvin during the weekend one night to explore their bar/night-life.  It was definitely one of the bars to go to in DC.  They have multiple bars and an open rooftop bar!  This place was poppin and it had a great vibe with fresh air and drinks.  Even though it was packed they made their drinks quick and they were good solid drinks.  A fun place to go with a group of friends and enjoy each other's company."", 'So I gave Marvin another try when my friends decided to go for dinner. We went on a cold Friday night so the crowd was minimal to nonexistent at the bars on the deck upstairs. I didn\'t check out the roof deck on my last visit but it\'s easy to see why it\'s so popular when the weather is nice. The atmosphere is great and even during the cold one side of the deck is heated so it is still amenable to outdoor spirits and conversation.   Since there was no line at the bar on the non-heated side my friend and I sat down and had beers while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive for the reservation. I\'m not much on beer so I asked for a cider. They didn\'t have any so the bartender kindly offered me a sample of a Hoegaarden. I loved it and ordered a full glass. It was the first beer I\'ve had that I actually enjoyed and I\'ve tried several.   After the rest of our friends arrived we were seated at a table downstairs and promptly served. I wasn\'t particularly hungry so I chose to snack on the ""frites"" my friends ordered. In combination with the dipping sauces which included a wasabi flavored one they were amazing. I loved every bite.  Also understanding that the restaurant is inspired by Marvin Gaye\'s time in Belgium I\'m no longer as critical of the restaurant\'s lack of soulful flair. However it would be nice to hear one of his hits on my next visit.  Thanks to my friends I gave Marvin another shot and I\'m very glad I did.']","[""One of the best meals had in DC by far.

We had to wait at the bar because they will not seat incomplete parties.   Nonetheless the food is definitely worth the wait. The theme is interesting. Its a mixture between a belgian dark lit cafe with the soulfulness of Marvin Gaye himself. My party shared the shrimp and grits mushroom tartine and bbq ribs appetizers. I haven't tried a lot of grits before but this one was spectacular. It was creamy and cheesey. Mushroom tartine was a must because of the poached egg and mushroom- 2 of my fav ingredients the grilled country bread soaked up the runny yolk and mushroom juices very well. Bbq ribs were decent fall off the bone meaty and the sauce was finger licking good. Bf and I shared the chicken and waffle which was a portioned just right for us because with appetizers and shared entree we were certainly full. That CHICKEN was AMAZING. One of the best fried chickens I have tried. Super crispy and tender on the inside. Waffle was ok; was a bit on the soggy side. I prefer my waffles toasty and somewhat crunchy exterior.   Ended dinner with warm toffee cake which our table of 4 shared. Soo good. The cake had a consistency almost like a carrot cake thick and meaty. The salted caramel ice cream on top was really the cherry on top of the entire meal."", ""Want to avoid the loud noise and crowd at Marvin? Simply arrive at 5:30pm for dinner on a weekday. It's worth it so you can focus on the food.  I highly recommend bypassing the chicken and waffles (shocking I know). It's delicious yes but the waffle gets soggy having sat between a bed of greens and a heavy piece of fried chicken breast. I'm a crispy waffle kinda gal.  Instead order as many appetizers as can fit your stomach. Creamy duck liver mousse with perfectly toasted bread. Soft melt in your mouth pork ribs. Mushroom lovers must get the mushroom tartine with poached egg (who can turn down a dish with an egg on it?). A simple but flavorful onion soup. Now I'm hungry again."", ""Night-Life Only Review (I have yet to try their awesome food and menu):  There was quite a line outside the door when we rolled through. Marvin's must've been the chosen spot that Friday night even after midnight. Anyways there was no cover so we waited patiently to get inside.  They have an awesome spacious rooftop area with two bars and way better bar service out in that area vs. the inside nook and cranny where the DJ was posted up. The bartender in that small nook and cranny of a bar located inside was draggin' ass the entire night. You practically sober up just waiting to order your next drink.   It took awhile for the music to pick up considering we didn't come through til after midnight. The DJ played mostly house music and didn't switch over to the top 40 old school hip-hop and r&amp;b classics until the very end of the night. As soon as the good music died off we were out of there.  Tip: Post up in the rooftop area unless you like being in crowded spaces and sweating your face off. Oh and slow bar service.""]","[""The more I go to Marvin the more I like it.  I've been for drinks on Sunday &amp; Monday; dinner on Monday; late night on Friday &amp; Saturday.    The drinks are strong and reasonably priced so yay!  I love the partially-enclosed heated patio.  Marvin is a chill place - no need to get dressed up and fairly empty early in the evening.  It is also fairly empty on Sundays but on Mondays the crowd starts to pick-up around 9:30 and old-school hip-hop is the music of choice.  Late night Friday/Saturday does not impress - the few times I've been the music has been lame and crowd was not my style.  This is not a dance spot.  Bathrooms are clean and warm.  I loved dinner.  While I thought the service was off (though the hostess rocked) the food was great.  I had chicken and waffles mainly because I've never had that and it always sounds delicious which it was.  A huge piece of fried chicken is served over a square waffle with collard greens and gravy underneath.  The chicken was juicy and tender with the perfect amount of crispiness.  Gravy added a nice flavor to the greens and though I prefer a crispier waffle everything worked.    I have no need to go back late night but cannot wait to return for dinner or even just to grab a drink with a friend."", ""I'm not in love with this place.   Ok so if I was only rating the company I'd give it all five stars but since I'm rating the restaurant it gets two. Not a fan of the automatic tip guarantee especially if the waitress is rather rude. Other than that the food was good but overpriced for the portions and taste. I purchased a tuna dish with greens for $28.00; it was the most expensive meal I've had in DC. On the positive side the food was presented nicely and did have a unique flavoring perhaps one that was too rich for my taste."", ""Want to avoid the loud noise and crowd at Marvin?

While we waited for some DC Yelpers stuck in hellacious traffic we shared these snacks --  Grilled Vegetable Terrine with Pesto and Tomato-Parmesan Jelly. I rarely eat the meat version because aspic is just meat jello. The agar-like thickener holding this loaf together tasted like solidified gazpacho. The veggies were lightly roasted and there was just enough pesto to give it a fresh zing.  Beet Salad with French Cream Cheese and Pistachio. Some say beets tastes like dirt but the saltiness of the nuts and creaminess of the cheese buried that soily flavor.

My suggestion skip Marvin and head down U Street to Bistro La Bonne.    http://www.yelp.com/bi...', ""Visited Marvin multiple times but only attended the bar briefly for my sister's birthday party 3 years ago so can't really cover that area.   FOOD: It's been said a million times but I will say it again: Go with the Chicken and waffles. It sits somewhere between love and enlightenment. The perfectly breaded friend chicken breast is almost entirely meat and not breast bone making it a more civilized version than other chicken-n-waffles because you can actually eat the whole thing with a fork and knife. Sitting on top on a perfect waffle with exquisite gravy and tender (but not sloppy) greens makes it my favorite meals of the last 2 years in DC.  The burger and fries are executed brilliantly. The dipping sauces that come alongside the massive basket of pomme frites are really crisp and seasoned to bring out the taste of the potato instead of masking it.   Onion Soup Gratinee: It is the sleeper dish on the whole menu. It is maybe the best onion soup I've ever had and had a depth of flavours that most restaurants in this area don't  even attempt to serve on a regular basis.  I also recommend: the Pimento Cheese Croquettes Gateau au Chocolat and the Toffee Cake.   SERVICE/ATMOSPHERE: The staff has an appreciation for the new visitors but an even bigger one for returning patrons. They start to become more and more friendly with time which I enjoy as a resident of the area. Sometimes service is a bit slow even when the food is fast to come out. But our water glasses always stayed full and the crew seemed to really enjoy working their and serving us.   3 out of 4 times we did not need reservations (just a party of two) but my advice is to try to get in the door before 11 a.m. on Sundays or you will be shoulder to shoulder with every early morning church goers regular patron or every in the know DCer.  Friday and Saturday nights can get crazy early and reservations are a must after 7:00 p.m. The background music is solid. I enjoyed Bistro's decor which is modern and cool but not trying too hard.  BOTTOM LINE- The food is sincere exciting simple and consistent."", 'So you sit down in this rather small restaurant and u get this menu. If you are like me and NOT from the south you may be disapointed grits. waffles. ick.   BUT then as you work your way to the upper right hand corner of your menu and you find mussles. ohhhh my JACKPOT. They serve mussles in various sauces. I am a curry person so I went for that. The mussles are served in an AMAZING tasty sauce in a big bowl with a whopping side of equally amazing french fries. In addition you get 3 dipping sauces for your fries (one happens to have curry in it). OMG talk about heaven! A friend ordered the mussles in the garlic wine sauce and another order the one with bacon and cheese i think? Both amazing of course curry won the prize for me but they were all phenonenal!

I've been more times than I can count we often stop here before seeing a show at the 9:30 club. Parking isn't easy; but I've always found a spot on the road.   We should probably branch out; but we usually order a combination of our favorites: the scallop appetizer some mussels the shrimp and grits (appy for my meal) and fried chicken and waffles (my husband's meal).

I have some reservation on chains as they tend to cookie cut the food and ambiance. I know it's still good with consistency.   The tricolore salad with arugula and cheese was very good. It was with radicchio endive and arugula and were all very fresh. And even with my usual dislike of salad dressing I decided to give it a try as well as my beloved pecorino cheese. All came out to be perfectly tasty!   I had the salsiccia dish and it was good and lots of veggies. My friend had the rigatoni with eggplant (replaced with spaghetti) and I could strong scent of it as it was steaming. My dish was a bit on the warm instead of hot so I was a bit disappointed.   The super Tuscan wine was great and heavy. The cab was a lot lighter but also pretty decent. I almost wanted to drink both but did not want to get drunk by enjoying too much.   Service was very good. The place is bright and spacious. Good for bigger groups or families gathering. It's elegant and somewhat formal table setting despite the attire is not super conservative. They nicely complimented my dress so it shows the more relaxing environment.   I do have one forever question why are the bathrooms always in the basement? I sort of know it's to save space and to keep the restaurant pretty looking it's just climbing back and forth those stairs is never my favourite."", ""I don't really know why you would go here seeing as there are many other smaller italian places in new york where you can get good food for half the price but if you are willing to spend the money and you are in the neighborhood I guess Bice would be a good place for you.  The buffalo mozzarella was really fresh.  The calamari was ok. I had the rigatoni eggplant but again why did it have to be 27 dollars?"", 'The concierge at our hotel recommended Bice so we went there one night to get food to-go.  We ordered wine at the bar and as we perused the dinner menu the hostess came over and suggested we dine in.  I pointed out that I was dressed like a complete bum but she insisted. ""You look great!  Please let me take you to a table.""  And that was that.  Bice\'s interior is simple but elegant with a slightly modern feel.  It was busy the night we were there.  Appeared to be the place for the older set to get their Italian fix.      The servers wore cream colored coats and seemed to number in the hundreds but managed to provide excellent service without interfering.  Our server was a hoot.  A former European power lifter with a dry slightly wicked sense of humor he relentlessly teased my bodybuilder boyfriend.  I loved every minute of it and also appreciated his candor when it came to the food.  I asked him about a particular entree he made a yuck face pointed to the pappardelle al telefono and said ""Try this instead.  It\'s one of my favorites.""  Though it was simple and meatless it was a great choice.  Homemade ribbon pasta and fresh mozzarella served in a tomato basil cream sauce.  I totally could have eaten a second serving.  My sweetie had the fettuccine mare e monti con gamberi funghi porcini e pomodorini which is Eye-talian for fettuccine with shrimp porcini mushrooms garlic and cherry tomatoes.  He wanted a shrimp alfredo type dish but the sauce on this entree was darker much thinner savory and in my opinion a thousand times better than your average alfredo.    Dessert was the only disappointment.  Tiramisu Della Bice a.k.a. Bice style tiramisu.  I don\'t recommend it.  Our server said it wasn\'t typical tiramisu but I was high on carbs and missed the hint.  It lacked flavor and seemed to be a lazy man\'s version of tiramisu.  If I had a do-over I would try the homemade cookies the warm chocolate cake with Tuscan dessert wine the vanilla creme brulee or the Napoleon.  Or maybe all four!']","[""Very good Northern Italian food. I liked the basket of rosemary rolls and foccocia bread. I was told the Osso Bucco Veal w/ risotto was the dish to go with. It was delicious. The meat was extremely tender full of flavor and the marrow inside was ridiculously good. The risotto was made very well and it reminded me of a trip back to Italy a while back. The place is expensive. I left full but I'd like larger portions. I'm more a fan of  family style italian restaurants."", ""Our hotel recommended this place and I'm glad we went. The food was really wonderful. We had beef carpaccio risotto with porcini mushrooms salmon in a mustard sauce. Everything was superb. But it is a flashpoint for wealthy dealmakers and it is very noisy when they are all there plotting their next corporate takeover while pa$$ing the bread."", 'Well last night was not my first time at Bice but it will definitely be my last. We stopped in after having drinks at Rothmans next door because we didn\'t feel like walking anywhere and we were hungry. It was crowded with the usual Bice crowd a bit older and a lot of tourists. There were 3 of us and we snagged a table right away in the bar area. When we sat down a guy immediately swooped down on us waving around a huge bottle of Italian water that he started to open until I told him ""tap water is fine"". He then sniffed disapprovingly at me and walked away. GIven the prices at this joint I can only imagine what that would have cost. We then waited FOREVER for anyone to even look at us! I asked snobby water guy for some service and he said he wasn\'t our waiter. FINALLY i grabbed the attention of one guy to get a wine list. I would grade the wine list average with prices above average. We ordered a bottle and seriously had to wait another 20 minutes before we could order any food. We split the tuna tartare which was the blandest I think I\'ve ever had. We then ordered a special the osso buco which was dry and cold and was served with very mediocre risotto. We also ordered penne vodka which was average. Yes people that was the extent of our food order and all total it cost us each $85. The osso buco was $44 and by far the worst I\'ve ever had. What is it with mid-town Italian restaurants that charge you an arm and a leg for below average cuisine? I know I know...who eats in mid-town unless you\'re on an expense account or visiting from another state. Well I feel for the tourists that all get taken at places like this...shame on you Bice']","[""I went to Bice for the first time during NYC restaurant week.  We had 8 p.m. reservations but arrived early around 7:30 and seated ourselves at the bar after telling them we were here assuming when 8 pm rolled around and our table was available they would seat us.  Well at 8:15 I check in with the hostess and she told me she was waiting for us to tell her we were ready which I just found strange.  We were finally seated but not given the restaurant week menus just the a la carte menus.  We had to ask specifically for the restaurant week menus and our waiter was kind of rude when we asked.    After we finally got the right menus our waiter didn't return for 30 minutes to take our order.  I ended up ordering the tuna tar tar for my appetizer the branzino for my entree and the vanilla creme brulee for dessert.  The tuna tar tar was ok but it seemed like a raw tuna patty with a strange mix of seasonings.    The branzino was good and it came with vegetables which made me happy but it was sitting in a ton of butter which was not the healthiest.  Dessert was good creamy but so rich I could only eat one quarter of my dessert.  Drinks were expensive ($16 martinis!) so I'm glad I only had one.    All in all I don't think I would come back here especially if it wasn't restaurant week as I think the food is way overpriced for what you get."", ""A couple of years ago I came here with a collegue but don't remember much about the food.  2 days ago I came again with 3 people for dinner.    I ordered the Minestrone soup which was OK.  It was typical.  I wanted it because it was cold and wet a perfect day to have soup.  For entree I ordered one of their special - Pesto linguine.  This was sooo disappointing.  So dry!!  I love pesto and this sauce never disappoints me... but this one at Bice did!   Just by looking at the dish you can TELL that it was dry .. and it was!  I basically ate like 4 bites and gave up.  It tastes nasty.  Feel like I was chewing on paper.   I ordered a Creme Brulee and green tea for dessert.  Dessert is passable.  What really pissed me off was the wait staff. They keep on hurrying us although there was nobody waiting for the table.  I barely had 3 bites of my creme brulee and the waiter wanted to take it away!!  My friend had the same thing did to her for her entree.    My entree was so terrible that I WANTED them to take it away ASAP.   Service was really just mediocre and I will not come back here again."", 'The concierge at our hotel recommended Bice so we went there one night to get food to-go.  We ordered wine at the bar and as we perused the dinner menu the hostess came over and suggested we dine in.  I pointed out that I was dressed like a complete bum but she insisted. ""You look great!  Please let me take you to a table.""  And that was that.  Bice\'s interior is simple but elegant with a slightly modern feel.  It was busy the night we were there.  Appeared to be the place for the older set to get their Italian fix.      The servers wore cream colored coats and seemed to number in the hundreds but managed to provide excellent service without interfering.  Our server was a hoot.  A former European power lifter with a dry slightly wicked sense of humor he relentlessly teased my bodybuilder boyfriend.  I loved every minute of it and also appreciated his candor when it came to the food.  I asked him about a particular entree he made a yuck face pointed to the pappardelle al telefono and said ""Try this instead.  It\'s one of my favorites.""  Though it was simple and meatless it was a great choice.  Homemade ribbon pasta and fresh mozzarella served in a tomato basil cream sauce.  I totally could have eaten a second serving.  My sweetie had the fettuccine mare e monti con gamberi funghi porcini e pomodorini which is Eye-talian for fettuccine with shrimp porcini mushrooms garlic and cherry tomatoes.  He wanted a shrimp alfredo type dish but the sauce on this entree was darker much thinner savory and in my opinion a thousand times better than your average alfredo.    Dessert was the only disappointment.  Tiramisu Della Bice a.k.a. Bice style tiramisu.  I don\'t recommend it.  Our server said it wasn\'t typical tiramisu but I was high on carbs and missed the hint.  It lacked flavor and seemed to be a lazy man\'s version of tiramisu.  If I had a do-over I would try the homemade cookies the warm chocolate cake with Tuscan dessert wine the vanilla creme brulee or the Napoleon.  Or maybe all four!']","[""(See pic)   Decided to have Italian rather than sushi for an evening and my friend did not realize it's a chain. I have some reservation on chains as they tend to cookie cut the food and ambiance. I know it's still good with consistency.   The tricolore salad with arugula and cheese was very good. It was with radicchio endive and arugula and were all very fresh. And even with my usual dislike of salad dressing I decided to give it a try as well as my beloved pecorino cheese. All came out to be perfectly tasty!   I had the salsiccia dish and it was good and lots of veggies. My friend had the rigatoni with eggplant (replaced with spaghetti) and I could strong scent of it as it was steaming. My dish was a bit on the warm instead of hot so I was a bit disappointed.   The super Tuscan wine was great and heavy. The cab was a lot lighter but also pretty decent. I almost wanted to drink both but did not want to get drunk by enjoying too much.   Service was very good. The place is bright and spacious. Good for bigger groups or families gathering. It's elegant and somewhat formal table setting despite the attire is not super conservative. They nicely complimented my dress so it shows the more relaxing environment.   I do have one forever question why are the bathrooms always in the basement? I sort of know it's to save space and to keep the restaurant pretty looking it's just climbing back and forth those stairs is never my favourite."", ""I don't really know why you would go here seeing as there are many other smaller italian places in new york where you can get good food for half the price but if you are willing to spend the money and you are in the neighborhood I guess Bice would be a good place for you.  The buffalo mozzarella was really fresh.  The calamari was ok. I had the rigatoni eggplant but again why did it have to be 27 dollars?""]","[""My dad &amp; I decided to go to a nice fancier restaurant and found Bice while walking around. We were both starving and ordered appys and entrees - and was hopeful for dessert. The latter never materialized.  Their bread basket had a yummy foccaccia bread -delicious on its own!  The Ossobucco was FANTASTIC! A recommendation from my dad who dined at the Milan location before. I highly recommend the Ossobucco entree to anyone with a hearty appetite! I couldn't finish mine because I was too busy scarfing down the proscuttio with melon which was equally yummy. The Ossobucco was the cherry on top - in this rare moment I was soooo full from dinner I had to say no to dessert! :P"", ""Sadly my high expectations for Bice were not met.  The food was solid but extremely overpriced.  The lunch was expensed but I could have eaten a more enjoyable lunch elsewhere.  Overall the lunch was really not all that memorable; it took me 2 months to complete this review.  I ordered a proscuitto and melon appetizer and the portion was so large it was unappetizing.  There's only so much salty ham I can eat; I am not looking to eat an entire melon prior to my entree.  My entree was similarly disappointing the tagliolini pasta with lobster wild mushrooms and cherry tomatoes.  I love lobster with pasta but Bice did not do a particularly impressive job here; they also charged a lot for that mediocre pasta.  The noodles were too heavy and weighed down in sauce the mushrooms were spongey and unappetizing and the lobster was slightly overcooked.  Because I had so much left over I wound up taking the uneaten pasta to go which tasted quite good the morning after.  But really... I love Italian food and under better circumstances would have eaten all of the lobster pasta regardless of portion size.  I will most likely not be revisiting Bice; there are better Italian restaurants within walking distance in midtown.""]","['bice', 'bice', 'napoleon']","['ice', 'ice', 'sorbet']","['steak', 'york', 'york']","['vegetable', 'soup', 'soup']","['chocolate cake', 'chocolate cake', 'chocolate cake']","['cheese', 'buffalo', 'mozzarella']","['risotto', 'risotto', 'risotto']","['creme', 'creme', 'creme']","['rigatoni', 'rigatoni']","['melon', 'melon']"

It's not really big but everything is delicious. I love jazz and its was even better to have perfectly cooked duck and listen music. Also if you are a meat person i recommend duck and don't get scared when they will bring you HUGE knife with it. I'm serious you can kill somebody with it :) And couscous with chicken lamb and vegetables is delicious. The only funny part is that serve it on pan not on a plate so feel kind of funny when you see first time :) As appetizers clams was great. Fresh and perfectly fried. Love it. Its a pit pricey but it worth it.The stuff is very friendly and know their job. Only one big minus is parking. That was our first time visiting this restaurant and girls on front ask you if you've been before or no. And it was really disappointing when we was trying to get our car from valet parking they told us to wait at least 15 min and when outside 15 degree it's not a lot of pleasure."", ""My revisit didn't fare any better........  Well the Beehive is just too successful for its own good.  The brunch scene is very nice and the waitstaff is attentive and self-adoring at the same time.    But you do go there to eat after all.   It was 0 for 3 and maybe worse in the food department.  It goes like this:  Eggs Benedict with short ribs:  the shredded short ribs are were a gross and greasy mass on top of b-u-r-n-e-d english muffins...sending it back would have been in order but its a drag.  Eggs overcooked and pile of nicely done real potatoe fries.  Just waay over done as a dish..  if my name were Jimmy Ray I might like it  Next 3 sunnyside eggs on some exotic sounding tomato base: reality... salsa as in chips and bottled reminisent salsa in a pool over polenta.  Whaaa?.... and way way overpriced.  Last the salmon plate for the light eating crowd:  overcooked salmon and low quality smoked salmon. small quantity and minimal greens or extras.. and overall looked more like an appetizer.  Other dishes seemed ok but no one was very impressed.  well except for the beniegts -spelling?- that came out hot and were tasty.    It was busy but well sorry you have to do better than that.  I have to say this is a Boston kind of thing.  - Ive lived here a long time-  Which is if a place has a following and a good market/product they get very self impressed and miss on details all day long.  Class it up.. it won't cost you any more.   Its more of the post-student syndrome.

Completely reasonable brunch prices great service my only complaint is the brunch menu seemed a little skimpy...not a very wide selection it was almost more of a lunch menu with a few breakfasty options.

Our server was very friendly and attentive. It was so nice not to be rushed and to have plenty of time to catch up with an old friend.   We chose a group of appetizers the mussels pirogi tiny beef wellingtons and accidentally a prosciutto flat bread pizza. I say accidentally because the kitchen mistook our order for mussels and made us a pizza (they immediately brought the mussels too). The flat bread pizza was the hit if the meal. A little spicy with sweet peppers salty from the prosciutto delicious.   All of the serendipity of the evening added up to a very nice experience. The jazz was a good addition. It is so unusual to hear live jazz these days and the volume was just right to allow for conversation while keeping the atmosphere festive.', ""The service here was really up there great. i was running late because of bumper to bumper traffic. i called the restaurant 3 times to tell them that i was running late even though i had left my house 2 hours early to be on the safe side but ended up being 30 minutes late still.   The staff and hostess was really understanding and accommodating to the situation and held the table for us. the place is always packed so i really understand what position she was in to hold it for me like that. she went out on a a limb.

It had pita chips whipped feta hummus olives pickles a lentil dip some sort of shredded beet salad sun dried tomato dip and roasted veggies...oh man it was so good! The poutine was good but I personally felt like it could use some more gravy.

The downstairs where I would recommend sitting  is architecturally beautiful with a large second bar. I would give the Beehive 5 stars for pretty.  Food wise I got a salad with grilled chicken on it and it was just average. The oysters were pretty tasty. So maybe 3 1/2-4 for the food. Our waiter was OK although I never got a refill offer on my beer that started at the bar.  But when I get treated like a jerk  twice for being part of a group it just doesn't make me want to come back.  It's not cheap and for average food there are about a million other places I would rather chance then return."", ""This review is more like 3.5 stars but I'm bumping it up a bit due to its uniqueness.  My friend and I came here Monday night around 9pm. We got in without a reservation and it wasn't crowded. We sat downstairs at a 2-person table with a great view of the stage. On Sundays &amp; Mondays they have a special burger menu which was amazing and moderately priced. There was a female singer that night who was a great singer. I also liked the decor- exposed brick interesting artwork and lots of little mirrors in the bathroom. The ambiance was very relaxing a bit quirky and a bit romantic.   To drink I started out with the Honey Lavender Whiskey Fizz ($10.50) and then later had the Lulu ($10.50). My friend ordered a beer and then the Cranberry Winter Mojito ($10.50). I loved my whiskey fizz drink but it didn't taste that strong to me so I switched to the Lulu. I think the Lulu was made wrong or I just didn't like one of the ingredients- it was very sour and I couldn't drink it. The waitress didn't ask me if it tasted okay despite the fact that it was sitting on the table for an hour or so and I hate complaining at restaurants so I just let it go. However my friend's cranberry winter mojito was yummy.  For our meals my friend got the roast cod with broccoli rabe and pasta ($22). I tasted the pasta (I don't like fish) and it was really good. Their burger menu isn't online but I believe the burgers were about $14-16. I had the hamburgeois and it was amazing. It came on a baguette with a lot of different things- pickles mustard brie aioli sauce etc. It was really delicious I ate it all and I was stuffed afterward. I also ordered a side of broccoli rabe ($5) which was good but it was so garlicky I didn't eat it all.  I was neutral about the regular menu and I thought the entrees were a bit pricey. However I'd definitely come back for: the burger menu on Sundays &amp; Mondays the drink menu and the ambiance/entertainment!""]","['I came here a while back for a friend\'s birthday party I believe it was a party of 8. I\'ve never had so much fun as part of a large party at a restaurant.  Things didn\'t go so smoothly when we first arrived; we couldn\'t be seated until we had all expected members of our party present. That was a lot less painful than it could\'ve been since the bar was right there. We ordered cocktails and stood around in a circle. Hah... cute I guess. I ordered a cocktail with Godiva chocolate liqueur that sounded pretty exciting. It was good but not as smooth as I expected. Since then I\'ve mixed Godiva liqueur at home with almond milk and liked the results better. Such is life. Luckily I had a Ginger Kitty cocktail during dinner and it was fantastic.  Once we were seated we had a blast. Cocktails and wine flying everywhere! Our server was nice attentive and had a good personality without being bubbly (you\'re faking and if you\'re not that\'s weird... stop it). I really liked that she didn\'t seem to feel the least bit rushed even though the place was packed. Basically: I liked this chick. She was happy to take pictures of our silly tipsy group on our cameras.  The atmosphere was not too loud which is surprising considering how huge and bustling this place was. Not to say we never had to ask our friends to repeat themselves. But it wasn\'t overwhelming and I get overwhelmed by things like that easily. There was a performance going on in the distance and it was the perfect volume and style for background music.  Now for the food... THE FOOD AAHH. I\'m in love! I believe my dish was something with salmon and lobster and a rich creamy sauce containing things I love. I\'m vegetarian but I\'ll be lenient at restaurants and practice some pescetarianism. Then after a few drinks I verged into ""Oohh let me take JUST ONE BITE of your pork. Because it\'s not like I\'m affecting the industry you already bought it! And you\'re gonna eat it all! Oh and your veal! And your chicken! And your steak! OM NOM NOM NOM!"" Um ah yeah... awkward. But tasty as hell. Sshh don\'t tell my other friends.  For dessert we ordered several options to share among the table. One of them was this absolutely ridiculous mapley buttery souffle type of deal. We were stabbing at it like rabid starved wolves and it was gone in literally 20 seconds. If it\'s not there when I go back I\'ll cry.', 'this restaurant is a really good place if youre in the mood for something a little different.  they have some really interesting things on their menu including roast mustard and herb pork and corn souffle.  the space can be a little loud if youre planning on eating and having a nice dinner conversation though.  in my opinion this place is better suited as a bar than a restaurant.  its a really good option if youre looking for a unique experience and a bar with a little more character than many other typical boston bars.  im definitely of the fan of the atmosphere if youre just looking at this place from a bar perspective.  they often have live music and its a fun place to see friends grab a drink and have a good time.  the drinks are a little expensive but they are usually pretty strong and for what you get i dont think its too much different in price than other places in the area.  i would definitely recommend their mint julep which i think that they are known for...its delicious!', ""Long overdue review...My girlfriend and I went to Beehive during Restaurant week actually on St. Patrick's Day for our first of hopefully many visits.  Beehive has a very unassuming exterior we wouldn't have even noticed it walking by on any other night.  We had reservations downstairs the hostess was very nice and we didn't have to wait at all for our table.  We got a nice two-top on the side not in front of the stage.  We had a good view of the rest of the restaurant stage and bar.  We like the whole environment everyone seemed extremely happy (drunk) and our server (Cory) was awesome the entire night.  We did the three-course restaurant week menu and started off with the baked goat cheese with honey and the chicken tamale.  The goat cheese was amazing served piping hot with fresh tortilla chips on the side.  The Tamale was OK not good and not bad lacked on the flavor and seemed like it was recently heated up in the microwave and not even for that long.  The entrees were to die for.  The lady got Truffled Mac and Cheese which was delightful and I enjoyed the Pork Loin.  The pork was fantastic as well.  The dessert was Irish Cream Cheesecake and something else (I forget apologies).  The cake was to die for and it will probably kill me too considering how heavy it was.  But the taste was perfect.  Besides the food being awesome (except for the tamale) since it was St. Patrick's Day there was an Irish couple that was performing for the crowd.  They played what sounded like (pardon my ignorance) stereotypical Irish music but it was awesome.  In between sets there was a group of 4-5 young ladies that did Irish step dancing about 3 times in the middle of the restaurant.  The only real downside of Beehive was that the crowd got a little boisterous at times (which we understood would happen on St. Patrick's Day but this is taking that into account) and especially the five top next to us.  They managed to squeeze in approximately 10 people into a space that is not meant to fit that many people and were basically on top of us the entire night.  Sort of wish that was stopped but couldn't do much considering what night it was.  Overall we had a great experience and we'd definitely go back again.  Service Decor food were mostly great.  4 stars 1 being taken off for a so-so Tamale and the insane group of 10 drunks to next to us.""]","[""I have NEVER been disappointed with my meals and cocktails at the Beehive. The staff is very accommodating (but don't be late - tables are a hot commodity and you have 20 minutes before your RSVP is forfeited).  Favorite cocktails include the cranberry mojito violette and beelini. Favorite food items include beignets moroccan phyllo cigars grilled broccoli and bacon quiche moroccan couscous with lamb and chicken.  The staff and hosts are incredibly personable and helpful. They're very willing to make suggestions and you can always strike up a great conversations. The live music is a wonderful touch and is not overwhelming in what could easily be a cramped and busy place.  I'll be back to the Beehive pronto!"", 'O woe we had such high hopes. After a Thanksgiving meal at The Beehive 2 years ago we just knew we had to go back again. Should\'ve stuck with those pleasant memories.  Place was hopping of course and we were eager to start our Thanksgiving Experience. Bit of a wait for our waitperson he arrived swathed in a woolen scarf (Are you about to bolt outside &amp; catch a bus?) and decidedly disinterested. He did grudgingly bring a basket of bread 3 pieces for our party of 4. We requested more.  Since he pointedly did not write any of our 4 orders i shouldn\'t have been too shocked when my 3 family members received their entrees while he scurried away to replace the one brought to me with the entree I actually ordered. My family was half finished when my baked lobster arrived.  The Baked Lobster with Lemon-Jalapeno Butter was on the website menu. It was offered as ""Brown Sauce"" at the table and I ordered it posthaste.  One taste told me the Jalapeno Butter was indeed there and my Reflux forbade me from digging right in. Small amount of meat and an inedible stuffing for a $35 entree.  8"" x 8"" paper napkins. Enough said.  The live entertainment was certainly that; a songstress &amp; bass player intent on long jazzy scatting that was loud flat &amp; out of tune. Imagine my delight when a drummer suddenly joined them to do improvised solos making any conversation impossible. Please leave Tracy Chapman to Tracy Chapman.  The pumpkin cheesecake my daughter &amp; I ordered were two distinctly different types of pie; different flavors textures degree of doneness. Mine had the whipped cream piled on to disguise the semi-burnt crust.  $200 without drinks--the waiter never inquired about any Dessert Wine or Cocktails so we cut our losses. Next year: Butterball.', ""The service here was really up there great. i was running late because of bumper to bumper traffic. i called the restaurant 3 times to tell them that i was running late even though i had left my house 2 hours early to be on the safe side but ended up being 30 minutes late still.   The staff and hostess was really understanding and accommodating to the situation and held the table for us. the place is always packed so i really understand what position she was in to hold it for me like that. she went out on a a limb.   Appetizer - amazing pizza and mussels with bread orgasmic. please try this!  Entree - pasta was too salty and under cooked left something to be desired...  Dessert - choco moouse pudding was too sweet the whip cream on top wasn't that great...yeah something from market basket would've done the job.  Drinks - drinks are often mixed pretty strong for me since i usually order complicated drinks to begin with.  bartender's mixology knowledge was mediocre.  Reason why I gave it 3 stars because of the price and the taste of food didn't match up.  service was fantastical however food...um what's the hype again?   my 2 other friends and i walked out of there full buzzed and generous with tip.  valet had no complaints although i wish they were a little faster with my car.""]","['After having an intense love sesh of Beehive on my first visit I wanted more. I picked them for the spot of my 29th bday. I called two weeks in advance to book a table for 16 during their Jazz Brunch. Even with weeks notice I had to bump up the time I orginally wanted which was not that big of a deal. Hey- you\'re popular Beehive. I get it. When the lady booking my reservation let me know that we\'d have to be at two tables- only 12 people can sit at one table. Being together was important- who wants to be split across two tables?   So I made mental note and only brought 12 people to the brunch. They sat us quickly- at 2 tables. I couldn\'t believe that was happening. I suggested everything- pushing the tables together joining with a smaller tables. Beehive wouldn\'t have any of it. Thus my friends awkwardly had to chose tables and I had to bounce back and forth. LAME. We even got different waiters and our food came out at different times. Double LAME.  Our waitress was one of those ""I\'m too cool to actually be informative/sarcastic/hungover"" type. When I asked for guidance on the menu she just said ""We\'re the Beehive. We don\'t suck."" I ordered the salmon eggs benedict. It didn\'t suck... but I sure didn\'t want to be paying $14 for it. The salmon was completely overpowered by other flavors and ended up just being a slimey texture.  Even though my reservation was booked as a birthday my friends brought me a cupcake and sang me happy birthday no mention ever came from Beehive or our too cool waitress.   A complete letdown. I was so disappointed. I emailed Beehive later that week and they emailed me back that they would ""look into it"". I had to keep emailing for an answer of why we couldn\'t have sat together had the same waiter or celebrated my birthday... none really ever came. Just an offering for a gift card which I accepted. It never came....   Beehive you may make a good cocktail.. but you suck for important events and reservations. Never again.', ""I've been here a few times and never got around to writing a review.  I went recently with my friend and it was a fun experience overall.    We went downstairs and wanted to sit at the bar it was pretty packed but we saw a few empty seats that people were leaning on and asked if we could use them out of politeness and they said straight up..NO!  Now this would be rude in normal circumstances right?  My friend is 7 months pregnant and these guys straight out refused a pregnant woman a chair...WTF is that???? I talked to the management 'cause don't be effin with an Irish girl and her 7 months preggers friend.  We got nice seats at the bar. The bartender was a sweetie and really took care of us.  We shared the hummus plate and the popovers for starters and shared the burger as our main dish.  The food was good but didn't blow me away.  I think I will go again and try something other than the norm and see how I feel.  On another note this place has a great atmosphere and is quite the meat market if you are looking for that...even on a walk to the bathroom :-)  So ladies if you are looking to meet men come here and prop yourself at the bar with some girlfriends and have fun flirting and hanging out."", ""Long overdue review...My girlfriend and I went to Beehive during Restaurant week actually on St. Patrick's Day for our first of hopefully many visits.

I am usually here for brunch or for drinks in the evening...listening to the live music.  I am ecstatic about the updated/upgraded Brunch menu.  I am a huge fan of champagne cocktails and The Beehive's list is unique and interesting!  I have never been a fan of French onion soup yet they have totally addicted me to theirs!  The beef stock isn't watered down as with most french onion soup and the carmelized onions were cooked perfectly.  The crouton was firm versus soggy as with most and the gruyere was baked to perfection over the whole concoction.  The waitress suggested a dab of tabasco which was really a nice touch.  I know I am going on and on about just a soup but I've never had it prepared so well! :0)  I am not a fan of the beignets...and I've found the French toast to be a bit dry. Some of my favorite brunch items: The Morrocan cigars (lamb springrolls) are awesome; the eggs shakshuka is an interesting mix.  The polenta is creamy and the moroccan sausage is terrific. I also love the shimp/roasted pepper/feta quiche.  The pie crust is thick flaky and buttery!  The short rib fontina grilled cheese is also a good choice.  For dinner the ribs and duck breast are brilliant."", ""Having heard many good things about Beehive but never having experienced it myself I dropped in during restaurant week with a friend to try the prix fixe menu.  The wait staff was very friendly and courteous and the place looked fantastic -- the different rooms had their own little vibes and it was all very attractive and appealing.  The food itself was good but not great.    For appetizers we had BBQ grilled shrimp and roast beef sliders.  The shrimp were seasoned extremely well but were just a bit more cooked than I'd like and came out on a rather unappealing-looking bed of greens bordered by big glops of blue cheese.  The roast beef sliders were definitely tasty but there were only two (am I wrong for expecting three?) and slightly boring.  The beef had good flavor but the bun didn't (even though it looked lovely) and the onions were too subtle.  A third piece to the sliders would've been appreciated (they come with two sauces ostensibly for dipping but one was an au jus).  Entrees were picnic fried chicken with watermelon and potato salad and texas bbq brisket with red beans and rice and corn on the cob.  I thought the chicken was pretty good -- the meat itself was juicy and the fried bits reminded me very much of fried dough -- but my friend thought the batter soaked up too much of the oil and made it unappealing.  The potato salad was close to perfect but the watermelon was disappointing.  We'd both expected something pretty standard (a slice or two of watermelon?) but it was actually closer to a savory fruit salad and neither of us felt that it really worked or did the concept of fried chicken and watermelon justice.  I'm a huge bbq fan and was extremely excited for the brisket entree but the brisket itself was disappointing.  It was extremely thinly-sliced almost like roast beef and was too fatty for all but the most ravenous of carnivores.  Real Texas brisket is thick and tender; while the meat was certainly tender Texas brisket this was not.  The red beans and rice came curiously separated -- a pile of rice and a pile of beans.  They were both good but that struck me as odd.  The grilled corn was fantastic and delicious.  Desserts were solid.  The chocolate pot du creme was very smooth and rich and the blueberry cobbler was very tasty.  It wasn't enough to rescue the meal from a somewhat rating though.  For a popular pretty South End spot I was hoping for a bit more flair from the food."", '""FLOCK LIKE BEES TO THE HIVE!""- Beastie Boys Yes indeed. Have nothing but great things to say about the Beehive. The night...Valentine\'s Day....the mission...impossible. In Boston for the weekend with my sister her husband our cousin her boyfriend...with me as the fifth wheel. Our intention was to hit Toro a great Tapas place. When we got there the bar was packed like the L train at 6 p.m. Nowhere to move. No room ro breathe. Nuts. Now add to this group yet another couple that our cousin\'s boyfriend added and we\'re really not sitting pretty. Party of 7!? On Valentine\'s Day? Three and a half hour wait. We\'re F-d.  We take a hike and after a bit of a walk we end up at the Beehive. As we approach the entrance there is a doorman but he\'s got a smile on his face and looks convivial rather than off-putting. ""You guys here for dinner or drinks?"" He asks. We say ""Well we\'d like to eat but we\'ll settle for drinks while we figure it out."" He smiles and opens the door ""Put your name on the wait-list and head down to the basement."" So we do. We put our party on the wait-list as it\'s Valentine\'s Day and the place is like many others SAH-Lammed. Downstairs we go. The joint is jumpin\' and the vibe is right up my alley. Local artists are featured on the raw brick walls. The light is dim and everything is glowing from the twinkling incandescent bulbs in the chandeliers. With brick exposed pipework and supports the theme is very SoHo chic (despite being in Boston). Our party of seven managed to get close enough to the bar to order and this is when the place really started to get great. Despite how busy the place was the entire staff seemed to be thoroughly bubbly with positive energy. Smiles and service all around. In New York at the same kind of place I could imagine bartenders barking out demands for drink orders and waiters rolling eyes at customers who take too long to order their food. Not at the Beehive. Everyone was a class act ALL NIGHT. The cute brunette bartender with a big red heart on her t-shirt smiled at me and said ""What can I get you?"" I ordered two drinks off of the house cocktail list a couple of beers and then chanced a special request. ""Can I get a classic Old Fashioned with just Michters Rye a touch of simple syrup and a dash of bitters?"" She nodded and then said ""So no orange no cherry no soda?"" I smiled and nodded aggressively. ""That\'s right."" She went to work while saying ""No problem."" Nice. It was right about now that the host found our party and said ""You guys are the luckiest seven people in Boston tonight. A party of seven JUST cancelled. Follow me.""  Wow. The Valentine\'s Gods were clearly with us. We scored a huge corner table sat down and poured over the menu. Our waiter who looked exactly like David Mamet in Woody Allen glasses came over and gave us the specials. We ordered a few carafes of wine to get dinner moving. The food. Very good. After a mis-step with the French Onion soup things improved. (The FOS seemed to have had a tomato broth added and the consistency was so thick as to be almost ""saucy"". Not great.) But after that one little trip everything was great. I split a Chateau Brion with a friend and the meat was tender tasty and amazing. Blackened spices on the outside and deep red soft goodness on the inside. The twice baked potato side was to die for. My friend had a pasta with five different kinds of mushrooms that was blissful. My cousin and her boyfriend shared a Paella that featured huge chunks of lobster scallops shrimp and other assorted seafood with rice in a gorgeous cream sauce. Everything was so good. After dinner we could hear live music beginning to play. We abandoned our table as it was now surrounded with standing bar-goers. After midnight the dining room began to evolve into a jumbo hang-out. Our party motivated toward the stage where a woman in her fifties crooned great soul-love songs.  Now here is where Beehive really earned the stars and shot themselves to the top of my ""LOVE"" list. A few of the people in my party me included I\'m embarrassed to say became a little ""picky"" about their drinks after having had several of them. As we moved from our dining table to our ""cocktail"" tables closer to the live music we got a new waitress. She was all smiles energetic and very very cool. Long story short we were a little tipsy and probably a bit more labor intensive than some of the other groups. Our waitress didn\'t bat an eyelash. She was friendly kind enthusiastic and her motto was clearly ""Whatever it takes to make you guys happy. No problem!"" It was genuinely awesome...and I drunkenly told her so several times.  When we finally migrated up into the cold Boston night we had an instant pow-wow in which we all concluded the same thing...""The BEEHIVE IS AMAZING and we want to go back ALL THE TIME.""']","['plate', 'plate', 'plate']","['selection', 'selection', 'selection']","['toast', 'toast', 'toast']","['mussel', 'mussel', 'mussel']","['gravy', 'gravy', 'gravy']","['oyster', 'oyster', 'aioli']","['pork', 'pork', 'pork']","['beignet', 'basket', 'basket']","['lady', 'lady', 'lady']","['thick', 'thick', 'thick']"

Ziti meatball subs sausage and pepper hero sandwiches and the best damn slice of pizza I've yet to try in this city (and I've had a few).   It was inauspiciously hiding around the corner from the office so we took notice of the $.50 off board outside and ventured in. Cramped but prompt I got a massive sausage and pepper sub while my coworking compatriot got a $2 grandma slice*. We both scampered back to the office toute suite and merrily devoured our catch. Bread marinara sauce sausage peppers onions. Simple yet well executed and cheap ($6 for enough for 2 people!). We will be going there again believe me.

A couple of us had decided to share a Grandma's pizza which came highly recommended.  This is a rectangular shaped pizza with a crust about 3/4 of an inch thick.  Toppings were good but crust was just not my cup of tea.  For those who like thick crusts it is doughy and tender.    On top of the pizza co-workers of mine had ordered eggplant rollatinis from here before and when the sandwiches arrived the sheer mass of cheese and eggplant perfumed the entire office leaving the rest of us to pick our jaws off the floor and wipe away the drool.  The sandwich size is such that 3 normal sized people would have been able to share it for lunch.  The guys in my office take eating seriously and finished their sandwiches by themselves.  And this is why it's especially impressive that it would take two of these guys to finish one pasta dish.  The chicken parmesan however was on the dry side per one of my coworkers.  The italian sausage with peppers sandwich was good but nothing worth calling home about.  Maffei I have commitment issues when it come to thick crust pizza.  Always have.  Always will.

The cheese was thick and excellent the sauce was very tasty but way too little of it. The crust was not a like a pizza dough crust more like a piece of bread. Good thick bread to be sure but bread. The margherita at $3 was also interesting and worth the price as it was very filling. This margherita slice was something you would find in a Los Angeles restaurant.

We were actually supposed to go next door to Ten Degrees (you can review my review of Ten Degrees as well highly recommended) but it was way too crowded and there were no seats so we ended up at Luca. Luca is a small wine bar - its cute with brick exposed wall and an open entrance. The best parts about my visit to Luca were: (i) we happened to be there during happy hour (until 8pm) and my two friends and I each had two glasses of wine each - the bill was $15 total - no joke; and (ii) the bar was quiet enough that we could actually hear each other speak! Cons: (i) they only accept cash (that infuriates me); and (ii) the waitress was kind of standoffish and not that friendly. Overall a decent place that I would go to again if Ten Degrees is too crowded.', ""Happened upon Luca Bar with a couple of friends while looking for an after-dinner drink.  It was a Tuesday night around 9:30pm and live music was playing inside.  The weather was unseasonably warm so their windows and doors were wide open giving the cozy bar an open and inviting feel.    The Spanish music that was playing was great and we decided to setup our part of four right by the door.  The breeze for outside and the full access to people lingering on the sidewalk and the dimly lid indoor tavern had quite the bohemian vibe the neighborhood is quite known for.    Luca Bar serves Belgium beers on tap so it's great if you're a fan.  We stayed for one round of drinks.  The waitress was friendly and nice though it seems she had a couple of drinks herself.  Luca Bar serves food like pastas and typical American-fare.    Seems like the bar hosts many live performances throughout the week as well: live music and belly dancing etc.  Stop by the bar if you happen to be in the area you might find something fun playing that night or simply have a cozy relaxed evening with a friend or a gaggle of them."", ""While there is nothing life-changing about Luca Bar the prices for the area are awesome they surprisingly have decent bubbly and the bartender was super friendly.

We started calling this place ""the Spanish bar"" even though nothing was quite Spanish about it. The Hofbrau Dunkel when the tap isn\'t dried up is one of the best beers around.

The seasoning in the burger the perfectly cooked medium-rare meat and the delicious buttery bun with melted Jarlsberg and served with crispy home fries is enough to make my mouth water. Make sure to ask for some bread before the meal to get delicious home-baked slices with some lovely tasting oil (the vinegar that sits an inch below the oil is a tad hard to get to though!).  The waitresses here can be space cadets at times and the prices are slightly too high for a cash-only bar but great times are always had. Try to get there early on Thursday to see the live band and the possible treat of seeing the beautiful belly dancer mesmerize the clientele.     My biggest pet peeve about this place is the ketchup which is also reminiscent of Europe. When my friend and I go and order 2 burgers with home fries they bring one little saucer of ketchup. It\'s about enough ketchup to handle one of our burgers.

I really loved the chill atmosphere here and hope to come back soon for the bi-weekly flamenco nights that feature flamenco music paella and Spanish wines.

I was having a pre dinner drink with my Mom and she asked to see some ID ... for both of us. My Mom had a good laugh and explained she was over 60 and a grandmother of 4 but the bartender insisted.   I ordered the white sangria and it was above average. The wine was very sweet and had soaked up all the delicious apple flavor. It had a cinnamon undertone that became addictive quickly.

With pretty much your classic diner set up they serve breakfast all day long as well as salads and a special weekend brunch from 9-3.

The hashbrowns were just a little too crispy for my taste and the array of veggies in the omelet just didn\'t taste very fresh to me. I was unable to finish the scramble but it might have also just been the way my stomach was feeling at the moment.   Although the food wasn\'t anything too memorable I\'ve gotta give it to Mel\'s for knowing how to pack in a crowd.

They tacked on 15% gratuity even though we only had 7 people and only 6 of us ate. We were confused. The menu clearly stated that there would be 15% gratuity tacked on for parties of 8 or more. When we inquired about it to our server he said they do it for parties of 7 too and then he changed his answer to 6. When we asked the guy at the front he said the parties of 8 or more is a breakfast thing but it doesn\'t say that on the menu.

Our server was this sweet old lady named Flo. She was really enthusiastic and friendly even though we had a huge party of people. I had the Mushroom Burger with a salad. The salad was just a basic appetizer. My burger was served on wheat buns and lightly toasted - odds were already in my favor. I took a bite of my mushroom burger and it was surprisingly pleasant to my taste buds. The mushrooms were sauteed with onions and pesto - can't exactly pinpoint the ingredients - but it was definitely good! I didn't feel too icky after eating it because I knew it semi-hearty.

The waitress reminded me of Flo from the old TV show ""Alice"" only she had a more modern hair style. =)   I ordered the mushroom omelet with rye toast and cheddar cheese along with a glass of apple juice. The omelet was a winner; firm eggs sauteed onions tender mushrooms and gooey cheese holding everything together. The rye toast was nicely toasted and I added a little butter to munch on it in between omelet bites. The dish comes with homestyle potatoes which needed a little seasoning and I actually should have substituted those with fruit. Nothing to complain about though.   Mel\'s is what diner food is all about. There are a lot of new fancy diners that play on the old-school diner mold but Mel\'s is from that school so they know how it should be done. When I lived in SF I frequented Mel\'s after club nights or for breakfast. If you are looking lunch I would recommend the patty melt w/ swiss. The corned beef hash is also a solid choice and the milk shakes are AWESOME.   I remember coming here with a group of friends (maybe like 7 or 8 of us) back in elementary school in the late 80s when this location first opened. Our parents dropped us off and we each had about $15 for our meals. When we were done we only had about $10 in change for a tip so we left it for the waitress and I remember the smile on her face (having a bunch of 5th graders leave a $10 tip is probably pretty awesome).

And the prices have gone up more than they should in my opinion. A milk shake is going for close to $6 and my friends mozerella cheese sticks were $9.   I love the atmosphere and that its open late. Butttt I do not think my arteries can take me going to this place...', ""My husband and I were originally planning on eating at Hanuri a Korean BBQ place we had yet to try. After walking in seeing it was completely empty at 5:30 PM on a Saturday and checking out the exorbitant prices on the menu (17 bucks for tempura shrimp?!?) we decided to make a quick getaway.  So the point is we were hungry and driving down Geary St. Decided to stop at Mel's. We'd been there a zillion times before with mixed results. But here is what you can rely on when you get to Mel's. First of all they consistently make a killer milkshake. I recommend the chocolate malt. It's old fashioned style and so delicious I could just drink a couple of those for dinner. Next they have good diner food. The mozzarella sticks were really crunchy and creamy not rubbery at all. They always have good fries and they make a decent and large burger. I ordered the steak sandwich thinking it would be like a philly cheesesteak. I was a little confused when I literally received a steak on a french roll. It was delicious though so I didn't mind! I took half home b/c it was so huge.  Our server was an older lady named Flo who was super attentive. The service can be hit or miss here but she was great and checked in on us several times. Overall Mel's is reliable although I will say do not order the seared tuna sandwich. It's just not that good. Made that mistake a few months ago. Go with the American fare; burgers chili omelettes french dip you can't go wrong!"", ""I've been to this Mels a number of times and the food is very consistent. I usually stick with the more common items like their breakfast of sausage egges and potatoes or a BLT sandwich or the hamberger with grilled onions and mushrooms. The coffee is good poured and refilled quickly.  For a themed chain the food is always good and plentiful. The place is clean (restrooms too). It is getting pricier and as all things costs seem to be going up. But for this neighborhood it's a good place to come to have a casual meal with a friend. I wish they bring back the Frequent Guest Card (please!).""]","[""Mel's serves the basic American food BAF for short add an R Alex and we have barf. Enough humor for now.   I like the menu choose a hamburger or cheeseburger with fries. When I am wild and crazy I will get a BLT on toast with french fries. Really swinging out there on the culinary spectrum. Service is hit or miss or hit hit hit miss as in pretty good. The bad ones just do not last.   I have only come here after 9 or 10 at night so things are pretty quiet then."", ""Like almost everyone else I'm gonna chime in with three stars as well.  Service? Barely passable... at least in my experience. I've had bad experiences at other Mel's... this was by far the best but I wonder what kind of initiation or training you have to go through to work here. None? Probably.  I had a bacon cheeseburger and fries. Mel's back home are fuckin' 'tarded because they serve their burgers dry and give you a portion cup of mayo on the side. Now what kind of sense does THAT make?  This location at least knows how to make some decent food. The bun was fresh and wasn't cold right out of the package which is check point number one. Number two is that the bacon is crispy. Crispy bacon? Check. Melted warm cheese? Check.  That's pretty much all I was asking for and I did get it. At least it seemed fresh. I guess that will be my standard if I ever find myself inside another Mel's again is that my food comes out FRESH.  Their onion rings and fries are also tasty. If I had to eat here again I'd just get a huge order of onion rings to chow down on."", ""Very underwhelming experience.  I came here with a couple friends yesterday for dinner and we were all unimpressed both with the meal and the experience.  First the meal. All three of us got burgers. I had the patty melt which is something I love but unfortunately the bread was soggy (blech). My friend's got cheeseburgers which they maintained were no more special than an In-N-Out cheeseburger (though much pricier).  Additionally for the price of their burgers ($8-$14) I don't quite understand why fries don't come with it. They're an additional $2.25 when ordered with a burger and even more price-gouging is the $4.25 price tag when it's ordered as a side. Still you can't have a burger without fries so we ordered twisty fries with our burger. The fries were definitely good; if you go definitely try the chili cheese fries too.  Second the experience. When our check came we found out that the waitress charged us $4.25 for the fries that we had ordered with our burgers. We asked her about the higher price and her response was that we ordered the side of fries not the fries with the burger. Come on all three of us ordered burgers! We specifically asked her if fries came with the burgers and when she said no chose to order fries with the burger. It took talking to her manager (who she brought out of her own accord) to clear up the misunderstanding but we were already peeved by the fact that she didn't even offer to clarify that with us when we ordered.  Luckily for her we still left a tip but we're definitely not coming back any more. The prices at this place indicate a more tasty place than is actually experienced by eating here.""]","['mel', 'mel', 'mel']","['bacon', 'bacon', 'sausage']","['hot dog', 'francisco', 'hot dog']","['sauce', 'apple pie', 'sauce']","['favorite', 'favorite', 'favorite']","['onion', 'onion', 'onion']","['malt', 'malt', 'malt']","['dollar', 'la', 'dollar']","['stick', 'stick', 'stick']","['cheeseburger', 'cheeseburger', 'cheeseburger']"

Perfectly cooked and lounging in a sauce of garlic parsley and thick cut bacon the escargots were pretty much the best I ever had. However the blood sausage served in a cherry and walnut sauce was THE BEST me and my husband have ever had in our lives. You hear me Cochon?! John has been eating blood sausage since he was old enough to chew and yours is the best he\'s ever had. Believe me that is a huuuuuuuuuge compliment.  The entrees were on par with the first course. I ordered the duck breast and John ordered the pork chop. Both were exceptionally good with excellent and well chosen sides to match. Presentation on both courses was beautiful.

Our first choice had no reservations open even a couple of weeks out. Eventually we decided on Cochon a French country style restaurant with special emphasis on pork (Cochon means ""pig""). We have been there before many times since it first opened several years ago. When we arrived this time things had changed...and not necessarily for the better. Although the food was still excellent the service was terrible especially the server we were stuck with.  Let me explain.  When Cochon first opened wait staff of both sexes used to wear crisp white shirts black trousers shined shoes and those long white aprons. I think I remember black vests but I could be mistaken.  On the most recent visit the waiters wore matching tee shirts with the restaurant name. They both had long scruffy looking hair and full beards. They looked like refugees from a coffee shop. The hostess was similarly casual.  This was a warning signal that something had changed.  When we made the reservation by phone we were told the only time open was 6:00 PM. When five of us arrived as a group the place was completely empty. Our table for six was set up literally next to the front door. In late October in Philadelphia this is not a good place to sit especially since Cochon has no outer or inner vestibule or even a draft curtain installed. When the door opens drafts enter with the new customers and departing diners. It was a chilly evening. In fact the next day we had an early snow....  STRIKE ONE As the restaurant had no other customers we asked for a different table but were told that this was all they had available. After a repeated call for a different table arrangement they did relent and do some minor juggling and sat us two feet closer to the inside of the otherwise empty restaurant. The place contains perhaps 12 to 15 tables so I do not think my request was outrageous.  STRIKE TWO My daughter was running late she was still at work trying to get there as soon as possible. The server wanted to read us the specials but my wife explained that not everybody had arrived. I asked to hear the specials anyway as we may have a half hour wait but he declined saying he would wait until all were seated. I thought that was weird.  STRIKE THREE My daughter arrived ten or fifteen minutes later and as we were all chatting the waiter suddenly arrived without any formal attention-getting greeting started reciting the specials. I was involved in a conversation and asked him to please repeat the first item as I simply did not see or hear him and he did but he seemed miffed.  STRIKE FOUR My daughter was looking forward to her steak and frites but apparently Cochon is one of the few French restaurants on earth that does not always have this bistro staple on the menu. My daughter chose the pork shoulder but asked if she could please have it with the mashed potatoes rather than the polenta that comes standard with this item at Cochon. The mashed potatoes comes standard with another item not this one she was told so she could not make a substitution but could order it as an a la carte side dish for additional charge. This is a patently ridiculous policy.  STRIKE FIVE My daughter being a finicky eater then decided to not have anything at all. He then asked her...twice...if she wasn\'t really going to have anything.  I excused myself from table and chatted with the hostess. I explained my daughter\'s predicament but she echoed the no substitution policy. I got the server\'s name from the hostess and explained that I have a policy too. My policy is to report faithfully to Trip Advisor the pros and cons of restaurant experiences. I said I had the name of the restaurant and the name of the server and that they would hear from me.  The party enjoyed the food:  Appetizers: gnocchi with pork cheeks and cream with peas in Parmesan sauce two salads with confit de canard fried oysters and one more item I do not remember.  Entrees: pork shoulder duck breast pork combination and two orders of sea scallops.  Everybody agreed: The food was outstanding. The service much less so.  The snide server\'s name is Tavis. He is easy to spot... with his scruffy appearance and the way he peppers descriptions of menu items with liberal doses of \'you know\' when asked how a dish is prepared. He took the good feeling from our experience.  STRIKE SIX Tavis did stop by at the end of service to deliver the bill and tell us that as there were SIX seated there was an automatic 20% service charge added. I made a mental note to never come here with six people or more in future especially if I see this fellow working in the dining room.  Caveat Emptor at Cochon.', 'Came here for an anniversary dinner and I was not disappointed.  The atmosphere was quiet when we ate around 630pm and there were only about 4 others in the restaurant.  The salad with dried pork with arugula was a refreshing change from the typical caesar salad.  My pork caserole dish was a melange of different type of pork that was totally new to me.  It was salty but no excessive.  The service was quick and they had plenty of bread for my party.  Price is very reasonable considering the BYOB.']","['Review is based on the fantastic &amp; affordable brunch. Eggs Cochon Reuben &amp; Fried Oyster dish were all amazing.

Escargot tasted great and loved dipping my bread in the butter/herbed; fried chicken livers was rich and creamy.  I asked the server where they get the pork and she said they don't know she asked the chef and they didn't have a definite answer...sort of weird since there are so many pig farms in the 'burbs of Philadelphia! She said that one of the dishes was sourced from a local purveyor but didn't have a name. I was just curious as it was good pork!   The bread pudding was a nice end to a quaint relaxing meal on a Wednesday night. You need to try this place once.

It's a cute little place with really nice servers and fast service. We first split a bunch of apps and the escargot was delicious! All my friends who had the lamb (the special of the night) said it was amazing. I got the rainbow trout which was average however the mashed potatoes and asparagus were cooked and seasoned perfectly.   Then dessert! I had the poor mans cake (I think that was the name) and it was amazing. I would go back just for that. My friends just had to try the trio of ice-cream- because it included bacon ice cream! Everyone took a tiny taste and it actually tasted like bacon. Crazy!   Overall: expensive but not as much as you'd think. Expected the decor to be a little more fancy."", ""Cochon's exterior is warm and inviting brightly lit with a string of lights it is reminiscent of the cafes that liter Europe! It set the tone for a romantic and quiet evening! My husband and I were seated promptly for our 8pm reservation. The restaurant was bubbly with chatter upon entering. The restaurant was furnished in dark wood with simple votive candles on the table to set the mood. All things pig filled the space tastefully! We started with the Escargot and Pappadelle. The Escargot was a flavorful blend of butter garlic crispy pancetta bits pea shoots some tomatoes and escargot!  The taste was rich and decadent it made my eyes roll to the back of my head!  My husband was loving the pasta  no sooner was it set in front of him did it disappear into his belly and unfortunately I was not able to study it more carefully. The bread took a little while to reach the table but since it was fresh out of the oven we couldn't complain. For entrees we order the Magret Duck and Berkshire Pork Chop!! The duck was divine as the first course a beautifully cooked  medium rare!  The crisp skin really brought out the flavor of the cut the cherry reduction was a wonderful compliment the sweet potato puree was a bit bland thankfully it was not the star of the dish!  The Chop was massive! It consumed the entire plate! He normally doesn't care for pork chops but he was delighted with his choice! The breading on the chop was fluffy which segway into a juice white meaty center the sides made for the 'perfect bite' We were not able to have dessert but the coffee was a great ending to our meal before the food coma set in!  We had a wonderful dining experience at Cochon so yelpers make your reservation STAT! It's a bit of a detour from the hustle and bustle off of South Street  but well worth the trip!!

They should also give you one of those rubber pig noses to wear while you dine that sure would be fun.  Only have been here once and it was pretty good.  We had frog legs and beef shortrib gnocchi for apps both were delicious.  I had rainbow trout entree which was infused with pork flavor.  My friend had the pork chop which I most definately prefered over the fish.  The serving sizes were very generous so plan on showing up hungry or be prepared for leftovers.  They only take cash which is a little annoying so don't be like me and show up empty handed.  I ended up having to walk to a Rite Aid in the rain to solve the problem and it was a good distance away.    A nice BYO overall I'll probably come back sometime in the future with cash in hand.""]","['I had an excellent meal at Cochon.  My waiter was friendly and knowledgable the atmosphere was cozy on a cold and rainy night and the food was absolutely delicious.  I never mind waiting a few minutes for excellent bread especially when I\'m told first thing ""Bread will be just a minute it\'s coming out of the oven right now.""  Fresh warm and crispy... a very nice welcome!  The chicken liver appetizer was delicious crispy and rich and perfect.    The special app was I believe a papardelle with pork belly nice and garlicky in a butter base very tasty and the right size (not too big not too small).  Their entrees were similarly rich and heavy which is just what we were looking for.  Their pork shoulder steak was something new to me and it was absolutely delicious.  Crisped on the outside tender and flavorful with perfect accompaniments.  The short rib was similarly tender and delicious.  But despite all that wonderful food dessert was the star (at least for me).  I love pig don\'t get me wrong... but when I find a dessert I like this much it overshadows the rest of an already-terrific meal.  The Poor Man\'s Pudding is one of the best desserts in Philadelphia if (like me) you like your desserts incredibly sweet rich and heavy on the vanilla.  It\'s shortbread dough (dough!) served in a hot hot cup of hot maple-bacon caramel.  The top of it bakes a little into a cookie crust and a scoop of bacon ice cream rests atop it.  Break the crust and you get spoonful after spoonful of sweet caramel-y doughy deliciousness which cools as the ice cream sinks into the lava below.   Up there with Barbuzzo\'s Budino as one of the best desserts in Philly.', 'I was beyond excited when i made the reservation to go to Cochon. I\'ve described this restaurant as my white whale on the philadelphia restaurant scene for a few years now so I was amped to finally go and boy it did not let me down.   I enjoyed everything about this experience from our incredibly nice hostess to the mind blowing dessert.  First course- Crispy chicken livers with dried cherries walnuts in a balsamic reduction. Yum. Perfect combo of texture sweetness saltness in my mouth.  I always know that a dish is blowing my mind when I get secretly annoyed to have to share it with my boyfriend. Thank god he handed over the special parpadelle in return because wow. It was parpadelle in a rich buttery sauce with chunks of super tender pork shoulder. It was the perfect dish to cozy up to on this cold rainy night.  Second course-I got the short rib because it was described to me by someone else as their ""favorite beef dish in the city"" AND I love short ribs...especially in the cold. The meat fell apart the second my fork touched it it was that tender. It was also surrounded by polenta and wild mushrooms. This dish was cozy earthy and delicious. I was thrilled that I couldn\'t even finish half of it because that meant I could eat it the next day.  My boyfriend got the pork shoulder steak. I had never heard of pork shoulder prepared this was but it was quite tasty. I believe it was with an egg lentils and brussel sprouts. Yum. The only thing is that It was a bit salty so I would not reccomend it to people who aren\'t into salt but luckily the two of us love salt.  Third course- Yes we ate even more. We had to when the waiter mentioned the pour man\'s pudding. Shortbread dough in a bacon maple caramel sauce with bacon ice cream. Honeslty the description can\'t do it any justice. Go and order this because it is absolutely delicious. I think the two of us moaned after each bite.   Thank you to Cochon my white whale who did not let me down.

The food is a solid 4 and combined with ambiance makes this a great date place.  It seemed like the dishes reflected some German influence given use of sauerkraut pickled cabbage and mustard in the dishes.  My dish was a good sampler but the onion rings missed the mark and the pickled cabbage was an odd pairing.    The apps were spot on.

The answer is always it is being heated up.   The food. The roasted pork belly appt was good but not something that wow's me. The chicken liver appt was way too sweet can't hardly taste the liver. The duck breast with white bean was good. The beans tasted like it came out of a cassolette (sp?) and goes very well with the duck breast.   The noise. This is just one of my pet pee.

First off the outside of the restaurant has a very bistro and welcoming feel the inside is cozy and dim with lots of small tables all close to one another.   I started off with the scallops they were perfectly seared and really melted in my mouth. They came with a nice lightly dressed salad that went perfectly. My companion started off with the boudin blanc which was basically a pork sausage in a lentil and mustard seed puree.   For dinner I went with the slow roasted pork belly and Companion went with one of the specials for the evening the bone-in pork shoulder. Both of us couldn't get enough of our meals.   The pork belly was so incredibly tender that you could slice through it with your fork. Even though it appeared a little fatty once it was in your mouth it didnt even matter. The skin was crisp and the meat was soft and tender. The pork belly came with a side dish of beans that didn't even compare to the wonderful flavor of the pork. I could've done without it but I understand that they wanted a little more on the plate.   The pork shoulder  was perfectly browned and crispy and the meat was tender. My only complaint would be that there wasn't a ton of flavor to the meat. The shoulder came with roasted root vegetables which were cooked perfectly.   For dessert we split the short-bread pudding with pecan ice cream. It was tasty and the perfect portion for each of us to get a taste without feeling stuffed after.

The lava cake fell a little short i was expecting more flavor it was still good but if i ever dine here again id probably go with another dessert. a few that were mentioned made my mouth water.  Service was good and we were very late for our reservation and they still were able to accommodate us . I only had a few oinks ... When we opened the red we didn't get new stemware boooooo.. and my after dinner coffee never came out :(  I would defiantly come here again it was a great meal.  *Oinks = hiccups"", ""Holy Pig. I mean this place really knows how to get down with the swine. First off the outside of the restaurant has a very bistro and welcoming feel the inside is cozy and dim with lots of small tables all close to one another.   I started off with the scallops they were perfectly seared and really melted in my mouth. They came with a nice lightly dressed salad that went perfectly. My companion started off with the boudin blanc which was basically a pork sausage in a lentil and mustard seed puree.   For dinner I went with the slow roasted pork belly and Companion went with one of the specials for the evening the bone-in pork shoulder. Both of us couldn't get enough of our meals.   The pork belly was so incredibly tender that you could slice through it with your fork. Even though it appeared a little fatty once it was in your mouth it didnt even matter. The skin was crisp and the meat was soft and tender. The pork belly came with a side dish of beans that didn't even compare to the wonderful flavor of the pork. I could've done without it but I understand that they wanted a little more on the plate.   The pork shoulder  was perfectly browned and crispy and the meat was tender. My only complaint would be that there wasn't a ton of flavor to the meat. The shoulder came with roasted root vegetables which were cooked perfectly.   For dessert we split the short-bread pudding with pecan ice cream. It was tasty and the perfect portion for each of us to get a taste without feeling stuffed after.   The waitstaff was nice and helpful. I've said it before in reviews but I love when they aren't afraid to make a real recommendation. My companion was first going to try the rabbit dish but the waitress instead recommended the special which she said was a real crowd favorite.""]","['Was leaning toward five stars on this one but couldn\'t quite do it!  But to the good stuff first.    The place has a very casual feel (wait staff in Cochon t-shirts) and despite that fact that it was a Saturday night and the place was pretty crowded we felt the server was very attentive and we never felt rushed to move along our meal.  (We were there visiting a friend and had a LOT to catch up on.)  I had the spare rib appetizer (special) with onion rings - AMAZING.  Not really a huge onion ring fan but these were unbelievable.  Light and crisp and the onions melted in your mouth.  Then had the pork shank for an entree.  Tender and flavorful.  Just fell off the bone.  My wife had the chicken and arugula salad - also very good - but I liked mine better.  The defining moment however had to be the dessert (can\'t remember what the cake was) topped with something-bacon ice cream.  Had never heard of this before and thought it sounded a little repulsive but it was VERY tasty.    A few slight annoyances that kept me from going the slam dunk rating route on this one beginning with parking in the neighborhood which was very difficult to find.  (Finally ended up paying $20 to pay in a lot so we wouldn\'t miss our reservations - that pretty much killed the savings of the BYOB!)  And I was surprised at how noisy the place was especially at the peak when we first arrived making it difficult to carry on conversation.  I had also forgotten they were cash only which meant a trip back down the street to find an ATM.  Should have done a bit more homework before setting out from home.  But back to the good - GREAT meal.  Nice local flavor.  Easy walk from South Street.  Was definitely worth the trek into Philly and would go again in a minute especially if I had a sudden urge to ""pig out.""', ""After reading the specials on the blackboard outside my fiance and I decided to give Cochon a try.  We had the bottle of wine with us and apparently Salt and Pepper had moved.  Plus we both love pork =)  Well our meal here was almost a full week ago and we still can't stop talking about how good it was!  We are so glad we stumbled into this awesome little byob.  my suggestion go now and GET THE PORK BELLY.  It's one of the current dinner specials and it was freakin heaven.  Melt-in-your-mouth amazingly-flavorful goodness-- pork belly in perfect form.  SO GOOD!  It came with capers roasted brussel sprouts a poached egg and this creamy sauce that tied it all together.  It all went so well together.  I savored every bite.  My fiance got the Cochon plate which had pork sausage a pork croquette and yummy ribs!  It also came with onion rings some cole slaw and I think the same sauce I got on my plate.  Everything was sooo tasty.  We shared items and both cleaned our plates off entirely.  Our waitress recommended that we each get 1 appetizer and 1 entree but we just shared an appetizer and we both left very full and happy.  We tried the fried oysters-- 3 perfectly fried oysters in a gazpacho sauce-- very very good as well.  Even the bread there was very good.  Service was good.  Everything about our evening was very very good!  We were really impressed and will definitely be back... the hard part will be deciding whether to order the same amazing things or to try something new."", 'Ambiance 3.5 Service 4.5 Food 4  O/all 4  Came here for dinner last night and this quaint place delivers some solid food.  Few details: cash only byob starters are in low teens and mains are low to mid 20s.  Most of the main menu is pork...all were tasty.  Our grp had the pork belly the pork shoulder a skate and I ordered the Cochon plate which was a variety of pork items-- sausage ribs and pork croquette...it also comes with what I imagine high end onion rings might be and some pickled red cabbage.  The food is a solid 4 and combined with ambiance makes this a great date place.  It seemed like the dishes reflected some German influence given use of sauerkraut pickled cabbage and mustard in the dishes.  My dish was a good sampler but the onion rings missed the mark and the pickled cabbage was an odd pairing.    The apps were spot on. Our fried oysters with aioli and fennel was delicious; so was our other app of gnocchi.  I would argue those two apps were more complex in flavor and thus tastier than the mains our grp ordered.']","['chicken', 'chicken', 'chicken']","['sausage', 'berkshire', 'sausage']","['arugula', 'salad', 'arugula']","['fry', 'fry', 'fry']","['potato', 'potato', 'potato']","['gnocchi', 'gnocchi', 'gnocchi']","['short rib', 'beef', 'beef']","['belly pork', 'roast pork', 'roast pork']","['scallop', 'scallop', 'scallop']","['onion', 'onion', 'onion']"

Don\'t come here expecting authentic Indian because you will be disappointed if you do. Instead just embrace the ""flavors of India"" and don\'t think too much about authenticity.    Thali Tuesdays! Every Tuesday Bindi offers a $20 prix fixe meal called a Thali which Bindi informs us is a complete meal that offers a sampling of small Indian dishes. You have the choice of your entree among a meat a fish or a vegetarian option. It comes with a paratha raita chutney dal a vegetable dish a pickle dish rice and a salad chaat -- all of which change weekly -- on a giant wooden plate.   When we went I got the tapioca-crusted arctic char which was yums. Most side dishes were not memorable but I did very much enjoy the beet chaat and the punjabi-style cabbage that accompanied my fish. I know others ordered the malabar spiced skirt steak which was also a palette-pleaser.   We also tried the Warm Cardamom Cake for dessert. The cake itself was wonderful (you can\'t really go wrong with cardamom ever) but it came with a very aggressively flavored \'Indian spiced chocolate pot de creme\' and salted sugar glass that attacked my tastebuds-- I don\'t really know if that\'s what they were going for but I would not order it again.  All in all though it was a nice meal especially for the special Thali price. Bindi takes reservations by phone so that makes it more convenient.']","[""We eat at a lot of Indian restaurants.

From the get-go I was a little confused as they had an April March album playing which is a little like the Gypsy Kings playing at a sushi restaurant.  Now let me walk it back a little and explain that I found it difficult to rate Bindi as I kept wanting to review what I thought it should be and not what it is. Don't remember dish names but do their descriptions; please excuse my ADD.  Love that it's BYO since I'm notoriously cheapas... frugal. Just brought wine so can't review the mixers.  I had the tuna tartar flatbread with honey (whatever this one's called) and the pork chop.  Yeah I got a pork chop at an Indian place. Please bear with me there's a good excuse: the server claimed it was the spiciest thing on the menu. It was beautiful juicy well crusted and cooked exactly how I like it. The blanched veggies and potatoes went very well with it. Having said that though if I were the type of guy that spends Saturdays eating cucumber sandwiches and shopping for bluchers I'd have found this spicy. However wonderfully cooked the pork was spicy it was not.  The tuna tartar was about what you'd expect though I found the chippy things that come with it a little silly.  If I could fill a kiddie pool with the sauce that came with the flatbread though... that would be my kind of party. That stuff's crazy good and have no idea what's in it.  Everyone with me seemed to be very happy with their meals. Normally I'd try everything but the portions were generous enough that I was concerned enough with finishing my own meal.  Our server was very nice and knowledgeable.  The lighting was a little dimmer then I'd normally like but would probably be just right for a date.  Overall I enjoyed my meal here. The prices were reasonable and a great amount of care seemed to go into the food."", 'Its summer and there is an abundance of wonderful fresh produce available so I wanted to see what the magicians at Bindi could conjur up. I went on the Thali tuesday and was treated to a nice range of flavors. I ordered the vegetairian thali which included ""butternut squash"" spaetzel.. balls of squash in a tomato and pea curry. It was ok. The rest of the dishes were even better though. The standout was a cold peach soup that was refreshing and spicy at the same time. The raita had a bit of avocado in it.. and the chutney was watermelon with a bit of spice reminiscent of my grandmothers watermelon pickles. The green and wax beans served with onions and a bit of heat were a hit too. The rice was a bit of a mush. I paired this with two very refreshing summer beers.. Son of a Peach from R J Rockers and a Festine Peche from Dogfishhead.  They worked and didnt over power the food. The restaurant provided a great class for the beer and kept them cold in the fridge.  Service was fine though as I walked in without a reservation I was told they could seat me.. but I had less than an hour to eat. Not the best way to great a customer but I understood.  I finished the meal with the cardomom cake. The cake was nice.. the chocolate pot du creme was too much and also lacked spice. I loved the salted caramel .. personally I would reconceptualize the dessert and have the cardomom cake served warm with a salted caramel ice cream and perhaps a drizzle of something chocolate and spicy..   The thali is indeed a bargain. With the dessert the total was 29 dollars before tip and you are able to eat it all in an hour without feeling rushed.']","['I was skeptical of this place because of it\'s prices (it\'s Indian food!) and it\'s fusion concept.  I continue to be skeptical.    I went on a Sunday night after realizing Minar Palace was not open.  We went around 9pm and this place was dead.  Really we were the only people in the restaurant.  I liked the dark atmosphere and it\'s much nicer than most traditional Indian decor.    We got the Veal meatballs to start and shared the chicken tikka and pork vindaloo.  The meatballs were good.  The two entrees were ""Meh"" at best.  The portion sizes were okay - had a little bit leftover to take home but the food was nothing special at all.  And paying that much for ""Meh"" indian food made me shed a little tear.    One final down side - a good thing about alot of Indian places is their ability to make most of their dishes ""Vegan"" or in our case just lactose free since my boyfriend is lactose intolerant.  We asked about doing that with the Saag and we had no luck.  Sad.', 'My girlfriend and I came here for Restaurant Week.  Started with the Nimbu-Pani and added a splash or two of the rum we brought. $12 is a bit steep for a pitcher of something with no booze in it methinks... but good nonetheless.  For the appetizer course my girlfriend and I shared the samosas and the pumpkin chaat. I LOVE CHAAT and I LOVE SAMOSAS so I was happy with these 2 dishes particularly the chaat because of its interesting mix of flavors and tidbits. Seemed more beet than pumpkin but as a fan of beets I was rather happy with this surprise.  We shared the vegetarian version of the almond chicken curry (they sub really fantastic paneer for chicken) and the dal and wild rice dishes for our entrees. Perfectly portioned and again full of interesting tidbits of flavor.  For dessert we (again) shared both dessert dishes. By then we were stuffed and couldn\'t finish either but I loved the cinnamon puri used as a garnish on both desserts and although I am not a cake lover I thought the coconut cake was delicious!   Service was OK considering how busy the restaurant was- I assume it\'s much more attentive when it\'s less busy and crowded. My two specific complaints are that we had to wait about 10 minutes for them to notice we were done with our entrees and another 10-15 minutes were spent waiting for dessert....

All of the dishes we tried were really quite fantastic but I would easily go back for a huge plate of the Malabar Swordfish Lettuce Wrap or a bowl of the Mint Raita with the Date-Pecan-Goat Cheese Paratha. Although the paratha was a little greasy (it's made with CHEESE people) the mint raita was awesome and a perfect complement to the heavier paratha.  Also worth mentioning is that the place is cash only and byo. There is a wine/liquor store a few doors down on Chestnut st. so I headed over and grabbed a bottle of cachasa just before dinner. The pitchers of mixers were $12 each but absolutely huge. My friend and I shared the nimbu-pani (pomegranate-blueberry ginger lemonade) and it was fantastic with little floating apple chunks. Kind of like a white sangria. The price is totally reasonable especially when you consider adding the byo alcohol and the fact that we didn't even finish our pitcher before leaving.  In short the food was awesome service was on point the drinks were bangin' and dinner for two came to $56 before tax and tip. There is not a doubt in my mind that I will be back!"", ""Was a bit worried after seeing a few really bad reviews here but we had a really wonderful time here last night.   You should note that it's a bit loud and very cozy (you will rub up against other diners getting to your table) but that's all ok since the food is really great. We found the service to be quite good as well.  Things to note :   * It's cash only.   * It's a BYO. Bring a nice chilled bottle of Vodka and get the mango mixer pitcher (it's $12 and serves about 4 glasses). Perfect complement to the food.  * The Samosa app is awesome (there are 3 on the plate) as is the sweet goat cheese paratha (which serves enough for about 2 ppl)  * The Lamb Shank is amazing but pretty big. It simply falls off the bone.  * The vegetarian thali was pretty good as well but a couple of the parts were very spicy!"", 'The food here is delicious fresh and innovative; it\'s not traditional Indian fare by any means but rather more ""inspired"" by the spices and flavors commonly found in the cuisine. Being a BYO we brought our own bottle of red which went very well with our meal.  The complimentary starting pappadum with tamarind sauce was strangely addictive. I\'ve had pappadum at other places but the ones here were fried to a perfect airy crisp and were very aromatic and flavorful. We just couldn\'t stop and ended up begging our waitress to take them away so we could have room for...  The appetizer! We started with the Sindhi Eggplant which was phenomenal. The semolina polenta cake was crispy on the outside creamy and buttery with the perfect amount of chew on the inside. The eggplant sauce was flavorful and went very well with the whole baby eggplants and mushrooms. Then there was...  The entrees! We got the Pork Vindaloo and the Grilled Mahi. Both meats were tender and cooked perfectly. What I liked most was that each entree came with a generous serving of side items incorporated into the dish itself. The pork dish was served atop a bed of sauteed kale potatoes and a spicy red curry. The mahi came with lentils and sweet potatoes. The pork dish was apparently supposed to be the spiciest dish in the restaurant  however it was fairly mild compared to Indian food at other places. Again while lacking the true spicy kicks of more traditional Indian dishes the dishes were still flavorful and rich. Speaking of delicious I can\'t not mention...  The sweet goat cheese paratha which came with a side of slightly sweetened cardamom yogurt for dipping. The bread was flaky creamy with a slight tang from the goat cheese and a syrupy sweetness from the honey. This would have made for an amazing dessert but we ate it happily alongside our meal.  After everything we were stuffed! All in all it was a great experience. The restaurant is dark and small but nicely decorated and romantic. I found their cash only policy to be slightly strange for an upscale restaurant but apparently it\'s quite normal in Philly.']","[""We eat at a lot of Indian restaurants. Being from the UK we find most US curry houses quite lame and bland. I would say the Bindi is definitely stand out and I really like what they have done with the fusion menu. Sure its pricey but given the quality and thought that has gone into the unique selection of dishes I would say it's worth every cent. For two of us we spent about $100 without tip for starters entrees and 1 desert. We brought a long a bottle of Rum (its BYOB) and they served us a very nice mixer (mango sharbat). We should have gone for the nimbu-pani (Indian style pomegranate-ginger lemonade) which was what the waitress recommended. The mango mixer was very nice but after a while was a bit sweet and sickly .... well she did warn us. I have never come across this before and its a nice concept. High quality cocktails but for a very reasonable price.   The service is good and the decor modern and stylish. Location great. It's cash only but no problem there is an ATM at the pizza joint two doors down. The food was yummy and very well cooked. I started with the ghee poached lobster pani puri which was very different to usual puri. The puri was made into 5 tasty little parcels very unique. My Wife had the sindhi eggplant a gorgeous little vegetarian curry. Entree follow ups were just as good. I had the lamb two ways and the lamb was cooked to perfection and full of great flavors. My wife had the seafood goozoo which was kind of like and Indian Gumbo. Very tasty but not as good as the lamb. Which was stand out. For desert I had the vanilla bean panna cotta. Very nice. All in all great only comment would be everything is a touch over-salted.   Gourmet and up-market Indian food with a twist? I'm sold! Don't expect large quantities of bland curry. Do expect some very unique and tasty Indian dishes. Will be back for sure."", ""If you want to get happy then shove some Bindi in your face.  I'm sorry if that opening line was too strong for you but that's what you get for looking for dining advice on the internet.  Bindi takes your usual Indian food and puts a nice glossy sheen on top of it. The menu is really creative and you will probably have a hard time deciding what to get. Don't forget to bring booze.  We began with the salt roasted beet and radish chaat. I liked it but it did not make me insane with gustatory satisfaction.   By contrast the seafood goozoo and potato paratha were great. The goozoo is best described as Indian-influenced jambalaya. It is shrimp scallop and mussels in a tomato-based curry sauce with rice. Just imagine someone dancing the Banghra in the bayou. Yeah that's kinda how this tastes.  The potato paratha is also worth getting. It is solid potato bread with a scrumptious raita.  On a crowded night Bindi will make use of every square centimeter. I have no problem with dining next to strangers because I harvest eavesdropped secrets hoping to one day sell them to the highest bidder. However if you are someone who needs plenty of personal space(or are planning to drop secrets over dinner) it is best to hit this place up on a weekday night when it is less busy.  On the action-movie-parallel-satisfaction-scale this place is Serenity(I was a huge Firefly fan so this movie has a special place in my heart)."", ""Mmm. Thali Tuesdays. What a fantastic idea! My stomach and wallet are both happy campers.  So here's the deal: Pick one of three options - meat seafood or vegetarian (the night I was there: lamb shrimp or mushrooms). With it you get 7 small portions of Indian dishes. Everything was fantastic but here are some highlights:  - The lamb skewer was smaller than I thought it would be but there was plenty of food on my plate to keep me full - Gobi-matar was absolutely delicious. (cauliflower-green pea bhaji curry leaf chili-lime butter) I can't pretend to love cauliflower but this really was good! - I wish it came more of the zucchini masala paratha. I felt like I didn't get to really eat all the chana-fava dal or mint raita because i felt silly scooping it up alone on my fork - the basmati lime rice really hit the spot. yum.  Note: the offerings change each Tuesday (I think) so expect some different variation of the above  All in all definitely worth the $20. I will most certainly be back.   Bindi is a BYO so come with some rum to add to their delicious drinks! The Mango Sharbat was really refreshing and tasty.  Also don't forget this is a cash only restaurant!""]","['I was skeptical of this place because of it\'s prices (it\'s Indian food!) and it\'s fusion concept.  I continue to be skeptical.    I went on a Sunday night after realizing Minar Palace was not open.  We went around 9pm and this place was dead.  Really we were the only people in the restaurant.  I liked the dark atmosphere and it\'s much nicer than most traditional Indian decor.    We got the Veal meatballs to start and shared the chicken tikka and pork vindaloo.  The meatballs were good.  The two entrees were ""Meh"" at best.  The portion sizes were okay - had a little bit leftover to take home but the food was nothing special at all.  And paying that much for ""Meh"" indian food made me shed a little tear.    One final down side - a good thing about alot of Indian places is their ability to make most of their dishes ""Vegan"" or in our case just lactose free since my boyfriend is lactose intolerant.  We asked about doing that with the Saag and we had no luck.  Sad.', 'My girlfriend and I came here for Restaurant Week.  Started with the Nimbu-Pani and added a splash or two of the rum we brought. $12 is a bit steep for a pitcher of something with no booze in it methinks... but good nonetheless.  For the appetizer course my girlfriend and I shared the samosas and the pumpkin chaat. I LOVE CHAAT and I LOVE SAMOSAS so I was happy with these 2 dishes particularly the chaat because of its interesting mix of flavors and tidbits. Seemed more beet than pumpkin but as a fan of beets I was rather happy with this surprise.  We shared the vegetarian version of the almond chicken curry (they sub really fantastic paneer for chicken) and the dal and wild rice dishes for our entrees. Perfectly portioned and again full of interesting tidbits of flavor.  For dessert we (again) shared both dessert dishes. By then we were stuffed and couldn\'t finish either but I loved the cinnamon puri used as a garnish on both desserts and although I am not a cake lover I thought the coconut cake was delicious!   Service was OK considering how busy the restaurant was- I assume it\'s much more attentive when it\'s less busy and crowded. My two specific complaints are that we had to wait about 10 minutes for them to notice we were done with our entrees and another 10-15 minutes were spent waiting for dessert.... AND we never got our pappadums everybody on here seems to be raving about. Maybe I\'ll get better service next time I go- the food more than made up for it.  If you\'re looking for ""traditional"" Indian Tiffin or New Delhi would be more your speed.', ""Bindi is a modern take on Indian food. I recently visited India and had an urge for India food. I was recommended this one place but it closed early. So I decided that maybe Bindi would be a good alternative.Overally Bindi just didn't have that KICK and FLAVOR I experienced in India. I mean my bf who never had Indian food before thought it was delicious. But trust me there is better Indian food that trumps Bindi's short menu. And the rice pudding...was ICE COLD even for a cold dish it was FREEZING flavorless and sugar-less. EEH. But the rice pappadon* chutney and paneer were amazing. And the drinks/mixers were good especially if you byoPATRON.   And I hated that they didn't accept credit...especially when my bf doesn't carry cash.

Thep Phanom used to be one of our favorites when we lived in the lower Haight. Even once we moved to another part of town we kept coming back because the food was head and shoulders above the ordinary.   A few years ago they started sliding. It seemed that the drop in quality coincided with the removal of the specials boards from above the windows. Although it paled in comparison the food was still very good and we kept coming back kept recommending it as our favorite Thai place kept ugring people to go...   So you can imagine our sadness after eating there twice in the last 6 weeks and having two mediocre experiences. In December we ordered a pair of our old favorites -- tom yum goong and crispy basil chicken -- plus salt-and-pepper beef a new one for us. The soup was bland and unbalanced; the chicken formerly blessed with a wispy crispy coating now had a blatant battering; and the beef was interesting but not terribly Thai-flavored and unpleasantly chewy. We chalked it up to a bad night and didn't give it much thought.   Last weekend we went back with a couple of friends. We shared everything so I had a chance to grasp the breadth of the problem:   Som tam -- green papaya salad -- is typically blazingly hot and pungently tart. Thep Phanom's version was neither. The rather small portion was served in a cocktail glass.   Tom yum goong was dished out tableside into flat soup plates rather than bowls. The broth was almost clear not even a hint of redness from steeped shrimp shells or chiles. It tasted almost as bland as it looked: no hot barely any sour a paltry 4 shrimp for 4 people.   Larb ped featured tasty grilled chopped duck meat but the rest of the dish was bizarre. There were hardly any greens --typically you eat larb by rolling up the meat and seasonings in leaves of lettuce or other leafy veggies -- and again the spice was almost non-existant. Larb is supposed to be HOT!   Basil chicken with crispy basil (gai kprow tod) suffered from the same problems as we noted on our last visit. Very sad... this dish used to be a true standout a modern riff on a beloved thai classic. Now it wouldn't be out of place at a cheap chinese takeout joint.

It may not even be better than average.""]","[""What a disappointment!   We hadn't eaten here in years but it was always one of our favorites. We went Saturday night. The service was fine the atmosphere OK (except for the canned muzak) but the food was mediocre at best. We had about 8 dishes all told ( a large party) so were able to sample the offerings. The pad Thai was fine but the steak dish was way overdone -- charred actually the chicken dish lacked any flavor at all; some of the noodle dishes were greasy. A pork dish was actually the only really flavorful dish. Thankfully there are many other Thai places in the city."", ""Came here with a friend tonight and although the food is good I am still partial to my other favorite Thai restaurant in the Tenderloin.   Some things that I liked: -Duck Larb -Dessert selection - much broader than most Thai restaurants -Hot drink selection - included COFFEE and HOT TEA -It was CLEAN (The inspection score=100%) -The service was pleasant. -The menu had a lot of options.  I also ordered the Tom Kha Gai which was ok.  Nothing extraordinary but a good experience. Yet the cost is what surprised me.  1 order of soup 1 order of fried taro/yam (4 sticks) 1 order of duck larb 1 order of bbq pork 2 orders of rice (small portions) 3 orders of non-alcoholic drinks (1 coke 1 small thai ice tea 1 hot tea) and the bill w/tax (w/o tip)=$67.   EEK.   The portion sizes are smaller than some other restaurants. It isn't such a big deal for me as I tend to eat smaller meals anyways. The bowl of soup was large and there was leftovers (which I think that I left at the restaurant *oops*)"", ""Waiters in authentic Thai dress are the real deal at this unassuming Haight restaurant. We experienced a slight language barrier on first contact. But any discomfort from that and the tightly packed tables disappeared when the food arrived.  I opted for the $19.95 prix fixe menu. While all the food was solidly good the star of the meal was the appetizer -- long curved thick strips of fried pumpkin served with peanut sauce that elicted oohs and aahs from the table. The texture and taste make this great comfort food. The tom kom gai soup with chicken and lemongrass was tasty but pretty standard. My entree of tamarind pork was tender and accompanied by a sweet tamarind sauce that was too sweet for my taste. The freshness of ingredients was noticeable in all the food.  Thep Phanom provided great value in a city where that can be hard to find especially if you're not a local.""]","[""It's all about the Crying Tiger salad and the taro fries! This place is super yummy with good service... wish it was closer to my house!"", ""THAI-THENTIC!  Thai food served by waiters decked out in royal blue and gold Thai formal wear in a small palace-like setting with rich golds and burgundys surrounded by Buddha shrines and paintings; you can't get any more authentic than Thep Phanom.   On Wednesday 6.29.11 my friend and I went to Thep Phanom for dinner at 6 PM. As a full-disclosure we know the owner's daughter at Thep Phanom.   M E N U The menu is extensive with many items you will not find at your typical King of Thai or OSHA Restaurants. HH Specials (Mon-Fri 5:30 PM-7:30 PM): $5 appetizers and $2 off all beer wine and cocktails. All the food is made without MSG which is a HUGE plus in my book because I'm very sensitive to MSG. They also serve brown rice for the health-conscious.   F O O D  When it comes to ethnic cuisine I prefer the most authentic and exotic dishes possible so we asked the owner's daughter to order for us.   *THEP THONG: Deep Fried Chicken &amp; Corn Balls (HH Special-$5 Regularly $8.95)  http://www.yelp.com/bi...  Hot and crispy the deep fried bags were filled with savory pieces of ground chicken and sweet tender corn. The Thai chili sauce added a nice sweet heat to the golden bags.   *KOO GUT: Crispy Fried Yam &amp; Taro w/ Peanut Sauce ($8.95)  http://www.yelp.com/bi...  Thick slices of the yam and taro were fried to crunchy crisp. I have a taro obsession but I preferred the yam because it had a soft tender texture with sweetness that went well with the savory nutty peanut sauce.   *CRYING TIGER: Spicy Grilled Beef Salad ($14.95)  http://www.yelp.com/bi...  The grilled beef was wonderfully seasoned with prominent hints of garlic and ginger. The char from the grill added a nice smokiness and the vinaigrette gave a nice acidic punch to help balance everything out.   *THE DANCING LADY: Grilled Jumbo Prawns Stuffed w/ Crab &amp; Serves w/ Spicy Sauce ($14.95)  http://www.yelp.com/bi...  Huge succulent prawns generously stuffed with tender sweet crabmeat. It was a simple dish but the creative presentation the seafood duo combo along with the tangy spicy sauce made for an exotic dish jam-packed with flavor.   *TAMARIND FISH: Tilapia in Tamarind Sauce ($16.95)  http://www.yelp.com/bi...  The tilapia was crisp on the outside and tender flakey on the inside. It was coated with a sticky tamarind sauce which gave a subtle sweet and sour flavor that didn't overpower the delicateness of the fish.   *PED TOD: Boneless Duck w/ Plum Sauce ($14.95)  http://www.yelp.com/bi...  Similar to a Chinese roast duck the skin was ultra crispy; however it was deep-fried which crisped the duck pieces all around the edges while still maintaining a tenderness inside. The duck was salty and savory with a hint of sweetness. The plum sauce added just the right amount of sweetness with an acidic layer to help cut through some of the richness.   *BIRDS OF PARADISE: Chef's Famous Quail ($14.95)  http://www.yelp.com/bi...  Perfectly crispy on the outside the quail still maintained a juicy tenderness in the inside. I love that the wing was fried to a golden crunchiness which allowed me to devour the wing in it's entirety--crunchy goodness!  *Homemade Cream &amp; Espresso Creme Brulee  http://www.yelp.com/bi...  The homemade vanilla ice cream was rich and creamy with a delicate sweetness. The silky smooth espresso crème brulee gave my taste buds a nice jolt with a sweet bitterness which was balanced with a crisp caramelized sugar crust.  S E R V I C E Friendly and attentive but in a reserved manner. Food came out relatively quickly and there wasn't much wait time between dishes. Each table was given a water bottle so you can refill your own water glasses which I prefer.   A M B I A NC E / D É CO R  Classy exotic and quaint; Thep Phanom is perfect for date or a small group dinner. The customary formal Thai clothing the wait staff wears and the ambiance's royal elegance makes for a unique dining experience compared to other Thai restaurants.   P A R K I N G Street parking which is more easily found up the block on Fillmore Street.   Looking for a place to tickle your taste buds? If so Thep Phanom will provide you with that exotic sensuous gustatory relief."", ""A lot of dining is wrapped up in expectation so diner be warned: This is not your dorm-room Thai food. This is the real deal!  Go in with the knowledge that you'll pay more but you'll walk away with a belly full of memorable dining experience. Be prepared to step outside your usual Pad Thai routine and you'll be rewarded with true Thai flavor and spice.  Finally go with several people so you can order more and sample everything family-style. Must-haves for us are always the Taro Root+Sweet Potato appetizer with peanut sauce and the Crying Tiger Beef Salad to start followed by the Crispy Portobello Mushrooms and Eggplant with tofu and some kind of heavenly curry. If they're offering the Red Curry with Winter Squash and Prawns jump on it! Chase the spice with a Singha of course.  Khorb koon kaa!""]","['Love the presentation of the food it made getting every dish exciting. All of the food tasted great too. Had a $5 app for happy hour and it was one of the best fried spring rolls I have ever had. Definitely reminiscent of the egg rolls from back east.  Had a few veggie dishes and am excited to go back to try some meat dishes next time. The staff was also very friendly and helpful.', ""I went to this place Saturday night with three friends. We waited a half hour but went across the street to Cafe Soleil to have a beer in the meantime. There's not really a good space for waiting there.  We split the spicy papaya salad and vegetarian spring rolls. I had pork and string beans in peanut sauce my boyfriend had spicy pork and string beans friend A had red curry and friend M had some vegetarian thing i don't think I tried.  All of the food was great -- I would def. say one of the better thai places in the city. The service was also really good and I loved the vibe."", ""I've heard great and wondrous things about this place but haven't managed to taste them. I've been twice and both times I've been underwhelmed.  The bad (i.e. entrees): Panang beef was not at all spicy and although the beef was perfectly tender the sauce's sugary sweetness overpowered the other flavors. Crispy basil chicken with eggplant had about six times as much soggy eggplant as anything else. Birds of paradise (fried quails) were flavorful and crispy but extremely dry. Nothing was absolutely terrible but nothing was good either. I get the feeling that some things they have might be great but I've been unlucky enough never to order them after two trips.  The good (i.e. everything but the entrees): Spring rolls and fried shrimp rolls were great appetizers and their peanut sauce is absolutely delicious. Last time I went my girlfriend and I were sitting next to the chef's pastry school certificate hanging on the wall so we decided to order dessert. We got fried bananas a la mode and it was very good. It was a banana deep fried and served in a caramel sauce like bananas foster. They gave us tons of fruit with it as well. Service was perfect and our waters were constantly refilled.""]","[""A very handsome boy brought me here several weeks ago and while it wasn't a Blow-You-Socks-Off experience (the meal I meant) I can see how some people have a penchant for this establishment. It's cute has that neighborhood-gem feel and the food isn't bad (albeit a bit on a pricier side IMO).   He ordered the Pad See Yew noodles (did I spell that correctly?) and the waitress informed us shortly after taking our order that they were out of the specific type of noodle for that dish so we substituted the carbs using some shorter variant. He had a better experience with this dish the last time he visited this haunt so this didn't quite live up to expectations I suspect.   I ordered some 3 course meal with Bangkok chicken wings (something was unexpected about this appetizer but I can't recall what was 'off') Tom Yum Goong soup and Red Curry w/ Pumpkin &amp; Prawns. The soup was tasty but lukewarm and my curry didn't arrive for the first ~25+mins of our meal. We inquired about it at some point and it turns out the staff had completely forgotten about it :(.   Had the soup been hotter the noodles the right type our dishes arriving on time and had the boy not shown me the next day how easy was to make penang curry by whipping us up a batch I might be compelled to give this place 4 stars."", ""So sad.   Thep Phanom used to be one of our favorites when we lived in the lower Haight. Even once we moved to another part of town we kept coming back because the food was head and shoulders above the ordinary.   A few years ago they started sliding. It seemed that the drop in quality coincided with the removal of the specials boards from above the windows. Although it paled in comparison the food was still very good and we kept coming back kept recommending it as our favorite Thai place kept ugring people to go...   So you can imagine our sadness after eating there twice in the last 6 weeks and having two mediocre experiences. In December we ordered a pair of our old favorites -- tom yum goong and crispy basil chicken -- plus salt-and-pepper beef a new one for us. The soup was bland and unbalanced; the chicken formerly blessed with a wispy crispy coating now had a blatant battering; and the beef was interesting but not terribly Thai-flavored and unpleasantly chewy. We chalked it up to a bad night and didn't give it much thought.   Last weekend we went back with a couple of friends. We shared everything so I had a chance to grasp the breadth of the problem:   Som tam -- green papaya salad -- is typically blazingly hot and pungently tart. Thep Phanom's version was neither. The rather small portion was served in a cocktail glass.   Tom yum goong was dished out tableside into flat soup plates rather than bowls. The broth was almost clear not even a hint of redness from steeped shrimp shells or chiles. It tasted almost as bland as it looked: no hot barely any sour a paltry 4 shrimp for 4 people.   Larb ped featured tasty grilled chopped duck meat but the rest of the dish was bizarre. There were hardly any greens --typically you eat larb by rolling up the meat and seasonings in leaves of lettuce or other leafy veggies -- and again the spice was almost non-existant. Larb is supposed to be HOT!   Basil chicken with crispy basil (gai kprow tod) suffered from the same problems as we noted on our last visit. Very sad... this dish used to be a true standout a modern riff on a beloved thai classic. Now it wouldn't be out of place at a cheap chinese takeout joint.   Panaeng beef curry was unspicy badly balanced (sweet flavors completely overwhelmed the salty spicy tastes) and oversauced.   Thep Phanom is still OK but it's no longer great. It may not even be better than average."", ""This is pretty good Thai but the taste of the food is far from earth shattering. Dan raved about this place but warned us that the old timers have complained this place has gone downhill.   We started with the Papaya Salad. It was gorgeously presented but it was just shredded papaya. The Tom Yum Soup followed and came family sized and each of us ended up with roughly 2 bowls. The taste was a bit bland.   For the main dish we had the Titanic Beef which was by far the best tasting but most plain looking dish of the night. Then came the Tamarind Fish which was quite good but not particularly noteworthy. All in all the food is barely hanging on to their 3 stars but they get a little firmer footing for the gorgeous presentation and wonderful ambiance.  It's a fun place to go but not sure I'd make it a destination.""]","['curry', 'curry', 'curry']","['phanom', 'phanom', 'phanom']","['favorite', 'favorite', 'favorite']","['shrimp', 'shrimp', 'shrimp']","['peanut', 'peanut', 'peanut']","['salt', 'strip', 'salt']","['pork', 'pork', 'pork']","['tiger', 'tiger', 'tiger']","['spring', 'spring', 'spring']","['tom yum', 'tom yum', 'tom yum']"

Since we chose to stay away for the most part from most of the more touristy strip restaurants (not to discredit any of them) we were almost reluctant to try anything near Quincy Market/Faneuil Hall.  We had just wrapped up our last few hours for the long weekend and wanted somewhere with some nice air conditioning to chill out in before the trip to the airport.  Yelp led us here and I'm glad we came.  Being that I'm starting to write my reviews in reverse chronological order this one is still the freshest in my memory.  About as fresh as the seafood that was served which was excellent!  We ordered up a tuna tartar tuna sliders some fish and chips and the thai bouillabaisse.  Fairly simple or common food items yes but executed quite well.  I personally really enjoyed the bouillabaisse.  I don't know how they pulled it off but each type of seafood (huge shrimp x 3 mussels clams fish chunks) was cooked just right and for once I did not receive any of those maddeningly empty shells.  You know the ones that look so gorgeous on your plate but are like a tease with no seafood inside!    The thai curry was just right and brought the dish together.  It was a slightly different experience with each bite so it never got boring.  I've probably tried dishes like this at least 10 other times in the past few years at various locations and this is hands down the best.  An unexpected gem.  The service was excellent and I was a bit surprised that there weren't more patrons at the restaurant given how much foot traffic there was outside.  I'd definitely have no problem in stopping by again.""]","[""I ate here twice in the past two days. I'm in Boston for work and pretty much trapped (not that it's a bad thing) in this particular area of the city with not a lot of time to explore.   My coworkers wanted seafood so we found this place. I don't eat meat so I asked if I could have the lobster grilled cheese without the lobster. No problem. It was actually really great it was on a flaky sourdough bread. It came with tomato bisque soup which was delicious and a salad. For dessert I had the key lime tart. It was very tart! The bottom crust was somehow really tough and crunchy as if it was overcooked but that's a minor thing.  My coworker ordered the two cupcakes one red velvet and one Boston cream but they were out of the Boston cream cupcake so she was given two red velvet cupcakes.   The service was just okay. The server seemed like she was half asleep/in a bad mood but she perked up toward the end.

What happened to the brilliant and gifted chef of Olives glory? He\'s been spread so thin  - the curse of the celebrity chef - that every one of his establishments disappoint completely. If only he had stuck to Olive\'s and maybe 1 or 2 Fig\'s but no. He got lost with his head in the stars and sold out on the beauty and magic of his food. So disappointing.  In Quincy Market on my way to lunch and catch sight of Kingfish Hall. Told the BF that Todd\'s restaurants were amazing back when I lived in Boston full-time. Immediately greeted by a hostess who looks like she\'s in sweats. We ask if there are any nonalcoholic cocktails as the BF doesn\'t like to drink so much at lunch - she looks at the ceiling contemplating. ""Ummmm....Coke? Iced Tea? Ummm. Ginger Ale? I think they could maybe....um...make some other drinks and take out the alcohol or something? Maybe a margarita? Without alcohol?"" She obviously had no idea what was on the drink menu what\'s possible - the hallmark of poor training and a very bad sign for the start of a meal.  As soon as she walked away I said to the BF ""Todd English would sh*t his pants if he saw that."" His restaurants used to be top-notch the best trained staff customer service delight. I couldn\'t believe this could be happening in one of his establishments. No sooner do I say this than I look up and who do I see standing behind my BF but Todd English! I happen to know he mostly lives in NYC now so it was an odd coincidence.  I said hello as we used to have friends and business acquaintances in common - he didn\'t remember me and I wouldn\'t expect him to - shot the breeze for a moment went back to lunch. He goes back to a business meeting at a nearby table - def NOT in the kitchen at all - just to be clear he wasn\'t the one doing the cooking.  Waiter takes a long time to come to our table - did I mention that there was only one other table full at lunch time on weekday during the holiday time shopping rush? So he is most definitely not busy with other tables not that that should matter.  He comes over also seems not completely knowledgeable about the menu - we order: veggies tacos lobster tacos. Also has no other ideas about nonalcoholic drinks.  I order a nonalcoholic margarita. The kicker: it\'s a mix! Not even a freshly made margarita which as a former bartender I can tell you is one of the easiest drinks to make. Horrible.  Bread comes pretty good; decent flavored garlic something olive oil dipping sauce.  Food takes a looong time for an empty restaurant.  Food comes and underwhelms. UNDERwhelms. The BF\'s veggie tacos are lackluster at best; my lobster tacos while filled with a generous amount of fresh lobster are BLEH. No flavor wrapped in dry tasteless inauthentic tortillas a DAB of some kind of sauce underneath the lobster that I can\'t even make out - an utter and complete disappointment. We decide not to order anything else.  Wait for 10 minutes for the waiter to reappear with the bill. Put down card. Wait another 10 minutes for the waiter to reappear. Todd English sits to my left completely unaware. BF and I finally stand up and get ready to leave. Waiter finally shows up again.  BTW - the place is expensive. I am ALL for paying a lot for a great meal at great service experience- I don\'t blink at gigantic bill after an amazing experience. But a gigantic bill for a Sub-Cheesecake Factory experience offends me.  The restaurant itself is very beautiful and it\'s in a great spot.  Judgment: bad service blah to bad food all flash no foundation. It\'s too bad. Todd English used to have a gift.  PS talked to several friends and family members afterwards who told me that trips to Olives over the last few years have been terrible disappointments and they ultimately stopped going. Todd also told me Olives is closed - so now even the flagship has sunk.', ""What happened to the corn and lobster chowder? If it was on the menu I missed it.

There's something amazing about the tender fried fish paired with pickled onions and tartar sauce. I wouldn't call these authentically Mexican in any way since the taco shell is more like a square cut soft tortilla. 3 taco's come served on a teeny plate and costs you about $15.   The side of brussel sprouts served with cheese curds and bacon. GENIUS. I would gladly order this again. Eating this dish is like eating a salad with full-fat ranch dressing egg yolks and bacon bits. Not for dieters.   This is where the positive review starts to go downhill.   The House famous whole fish they flame grill was a HUGE disappointment. The fish was extremely fishy and super bony though it was tender. I can't see anyone truly loving this dish unless they were Bear on Travel channel surviving for weeks on end in the wild. Or you have few taste buds. Served with a side of wilted greens and a too-greasy white bean spread this dish left me feeling very underwhelmed. The fish would have been great with a dipping sauce. Heck I should have asked for ketchup.   The seafood paella was almost just as bad. Nothing is a bigger turnoff in paella than undercooked rice. The grains in the paella were SO chewy it was to the point of crunchy-ness. Don't bit hard...you might split your filling. On top of that the paella in general was so flavorless!

They're everywhere showing a wide variety of events and of high quality! SF's relative weakness in the sports bar category is a factor too. For a city of this size and stature we could use more good sports bars.   This is also a burger review since I'm reaching the last cohort of good dedicated burger places in SF. Specifically the Public House burger will not disappoint! It's served w bacon cheddar and avocado (well guacomole on mine) plus fresh crisp standard toppings. Four jars of condiments provided in advance of the plate itself. The patty was a good inch high and quite juicy. Perfect for flavoring fries in my personal steak frites fashion! They were whole-cut with skin on either en my favorite. Unfortunately they didn't taste as good as the burger because some thicker ones tasted as if they'd been fried frozen.   Regardless I absolutely devoured the burger less than 90 minutes after eating another entree the chiliquenos plate. (That's a formal way of saying Frito pie.)  The service has never met the levels set by the food or beer however. I've never visited on the day of a Giants game home or away though this last visit (NFL playoffs) finally revealed the restaurant with most tables filled.  Our server was quick to welcome my late self to the couple I'd invited there (yes very rude of me) and he offered the menus plus his food recommendations. Once he came back for my order though the mistakes began: forgot my water and then forgot my silverware and napkin twice. On that note the silverware and napkin never arrived ahead of the food during my two previous visits. Not even simultaneously. At least they're of high quality! Getting a towel instead of a napkin feels more appropriate for pub food even of the high-end variety.  So go to Public House for a very good sports bar experience and high-end pub food. Just don't expect too much from the service."", '3.5 stars. Everyone liked this place. Quite casual and spacious. There\'s a bar with a huge selection of beer on tap.

This is by far one of my favorite bars to come to before any Giants game or even when they're away for that matter. First off the beer selection is spectacular. They've had Pliny the Younger Loads of Dogfish Head's brews Stillwater Greenflash Lagunitas Stone Speakeasy Lost Abbey Ballast Point Moylan's and more great beer than I can remember. And remembering them all can be hard when I'm trying to sample everything they have to offer.   Now lets get down to the food. It's awesome! This place had one of the best burgers I've ever eaten. You know that dream burger you always remember for years and even dream about some nights (I don't know about you guys but if you don't dream about a good burger then we may be starting off our relationship on the wrong foot) It's a fat burger stacked with cheese bacon avocado (Thank you!!!) and all the usual fixins. The cheese steak sandwich is a thing of beauty. It's everything you want a cheese steak to be; gooey smokey meaty and delicious. The Mac &amp; Cheese? It was described to me as a bubbly cauldron of cheesy goodness and that is exactly what it was. I've even been so bold as to ask for them to even put bacon in it WOW is all I'm going to say.    Now time to cover the service. I've had great service every time I've been here. Lets get down to it the place gets packed before games and it can be a challenge sometimes getting a table but the management and staff have always been friendly and have helped to get me a seat. They are happy to explain what new beers they have on draft and even let me sample a few so I pick the perfect one or if I've ever had questions on the menu they will gladly answer any questions I might have.   You've got to understand this is a ballpark and there are thousands of people who come through the place on game days. It's going to be busy it's going to be crowded but if you like being in the middle of the action and getting right into the stadium from the restaurant with a great craft beer in your hand then this is the place to go.    All in all I love this place.

It was crowded inside but we got a table outside most likely because it was pretty chilly.   We both ordered the Tuna Salad Nicoise an order of Sweet Potato Fries to share and two beer. The salads came out fast but were not great. There was very little tuna only a few fingerling potatoes hard boiled eggs and a few olives. Disappointedly no haricot vert. All and all it was like bagged lettuce with a few pieces of oil packed albacore tuna and a olive oil dressing for $14. I will not order it again. Sadly it was the most healthy option on the menu so I am in a corner. Do I go for the hearty meat or eat else where.   Sweat Potato Fries were fantastic!!! I will head back for beer and fries in the future.   Would like to see some other light fare on the menu in the future. I know it is the game but I prefer to drink my calories.', 'Had a great Sunday here! The manager helped switch a TV to my game. The beer list blew my mind. I love tasting small batch brews from Idaho to San Diego. The Mijita nachos are amazing and you can order them in Public House. The burger is solid and my girl enjoyed the Greek salad. Definitely coming back for another Sunday Funday!']","[""So much better than Mijitas next door. Case in point: Public House was fairly full for a Wednesday night. Mijitas nearly empty.  Enjoyed the crab cake with aiole beef sliders bubbling hot mac &amp; cheese and a chicken sandwich (grilled with yummy figs for that something special). Including a beer this meal ran about $50. Not cheap but the food was good. Don't know if it's $50 worth of good but we'd still go back."", ""There's something about beer and baseball that go so well together.   Hearing that Public House has one of the largest draft beer (80% local) and cask ale offerings in SF I came here with my friend Phil D. on an off day to watch the Giants play the lowly Dodgers.   It wasn't busy inside but guess what? Public House was out some beers? The tap was decent so plan B worked and is it to much to ask to serve the beer colder or in a frosted glass? ( http://www.yelp.com/bi... )  Inside it's more upscale with a good amount of plasmas with premier pub grub (crab cakes deviled eggs etc). Ordered a couple lamb sliders. Decent and flavorful but for 2 bite size sliders @ $10 bucks I wouldn't call it Man Food. ( http://www.yelp.com/bi... )  Public House is more on the Palomino Tres Agaves Paragon and Momo's tier but for game day I prefer local favorite Zeke's around the corner to grab some nice cold ones."", ""I came here to watch the Lakers and Giants kick some ass (which they did) and eat a burger and enjoy some good brews. We started off with the delectable crab cakes. I've never had a crab cake before so this probably doesn't mean too much but it was the best crab cake I've ever had! :P  I also started off with the Racer IPA ($6) and then went with the Moylans Kilt Lifter Scotch Ale * 8% * $7 * Amazeballs!!!   The bacon and guacamole burger met expectations and was just as good as the delicious appetizer and refreshing brews. This is supposedly a great place to come before/during/after a Giants home game but I say it's great anytime!""]","[""I have to admit the combination of Public House and Mijita is a lot smarter use of the space formerly occupied by the Acme Chop House. Who wants a sit-down dinner at a medium-priced restaurant before going to a ballgame? No you want a brewski and a brat and don't mind the dribble of ketchup out of the corner of my mouth. Indeed Public House has a menu fit for a pair of shoulder-hugging weekend buddies or a gaggle of gossipy girlfriends. It's pub grub served amid an extravaganza of flatscreen TVs in a warehouse-size space. However it's a lot nicer than your average peanut-shell-encrusted bar with a dartboard.  And yet even with expectations appropriately lowered the execution of the menu items was a bit hit and miss. Jamie W. and I ordered the $5 Jalapeno Poppers four of them batter-fried with a green salsa dip (see photo). They had a more lasting heat than I expected but they were devoured in about three bites each. Blander was the $3 trio of Deviled Eggs actually three egg halves piped with a creamed yolk filling and sprinkled with paprika (see photo). What helped was using the condiments on the table and putting a spoonful of the relish on top of them.  I went for the $13 PH Burger which I thought was pretty good and generous with toppings - avocado slices bacon strips cheese red onion rings a couple of tomato slices big lettuce leaf - but the patty was significantly smaller than the bun (see photo). I call this the Beach Chalet Syndrome since the same thing happens there under the pretense that the toppings make up the difference. Uh not really. Jamie ordered the $10 Pacific Cod Fish and Chips which came with four fingerling filets and a nice pile of heavily seasoned fries (see photo). The fish was good and fresh though the batter was on the wet side and the accompanying tartar sauce was way oversalted.  Jamie was further tempted by the availability of Humphry Slocombe ice cream and ordered his favorite flavor Secret Breakfast a bargain at $2 for a single scoop in a glass (see photo). They offer two other flavors - Chocolate Smoked Salt and Tahitian Vanilla - and an array of Anthony's Cookies and other retro-homestyle desserts like butterscotch pudding. I passed for the greater goal of my retro-waistline. We were there when the Giants were away in Houston so it wasn't overly crowded just enough people to keep the place buzzing. I can well imagine the zoo this place will become during home games.  FOOD - 3 stars...pub grub with some panache but execution still needs polish AMBIANCE - 4 stars...spacious and stylish though a tad loud SERVICE - 3.5 stars...pretty darn attentive TOTAL - 3 stars...will reconsider the rating once they get established"", ""I love the vibe in Public House what a cool place to grab a beer watch a game or meet up friends.  Their beer selection is outstanding and the staff is actually pretty knowledgeable in all of them and can always recommend a fun one depending on your mood! The food is really good and they use a lot of fresh local ingredients. Apparently they are launching a pretty cool Happy Hour which I'm excited for.  A lot of people don't know 2 of the best things about this place:  1) you can bring your food from Mijita (the Mexican place it shares the space with) if you prefer PH's pub atmosphere/giant TVs ;  2) You can bring any food or drink you buy at PH into the ballpark during a game! They have a special door into the ballpark so you can come back as many times as you want to grab more beers or nachos. The food and beer is so much better/cheaper than concession what a hidden gem!"", ""I walked into this place right after they opened at 4pm on a non-game day and sat at the bar. The bartender was very knowledgeable about the beer selection and let me sample a couple before settling down to a Crystal Wheat pint.  The chicken sandwich I had was worth the $12. The lettuce was crisp the tomato was perfectly ripe the cheese was melted alongside the expertly seasoned grilled chicken and the bread/roll was heaven.  I noticed and wondered how they utilized their own entrance into At&amp;t park... guess I'll have to find out on a game day.""]","[""This place is pretty cool. I'm not much of a beer drinker but there was such a wide variety that I found something light and refreshing and my bf had his dark beer. The food was good and pub-like. We had the mini corn dogs (which were obviously made in house) the iceberg wedge (who doesn't like a wedge salad! so cute &amp; tasty!) the fish-n-chips (surprisingly good) and the cheesesteak. Our server was super busy but she did a great job. I'll definitely be back but will try it on a non-game day."", ""you know i have to say i was kinda impressed.  we went on a tuesday night when the giants were away - so i'm wondering if that has something to do with it.  the double bars were quite impressive - and on game days i bet they make sense. but anyway.  service was attentive and really good on suggesting beer and food.  i had the iceberg wedge salad with mac and cheese and my friends had a burger fries onion rings and sliders. everything was really tasty. the mac and cheese was creamy but not too sludgy thick and my salad was HUGE.  my only complaint is the price - for these things plus a beer for each person our tab came to 75.00 pre tip. holy cow!"", 'Very disappointing after a nice time in the ballpark. Our server was incompetent. We ordered drinks apps and entrees. After drinks came to the table we were asked if we still wanted our appetizers. This seemed unusual especially when our entrees arrived right after drinks. When we explained that we expected to eat the apps first the server offered to put our plates under the warmer until we finished our wings. Unbelievable. I ordered the cobb chicken sandwich advertised as chicken tomato blue cheese arugula and bacon on a bun. What arrived on my plate was dried out chicken Swiss cheese bacon and shredded iceberg lettuce. No tomato. Fries were cold. Only positive thing to say is that the busboys were on top of water refills. PH = FAIL']","[""As the final food stop on the Yapsie SOMA Pupcrawl everybody was excited to enjoy some snacks and beers. When we pulled up the side gate was wide open for us and we were greeted by the super friendly staff. It was pretty clear that everybody loves dogs!  We started off with pitchers of local brews Racer 5 and Trumer Pils which quickly ended up being quite a few more pitchers after that. Not only did everybody love dogs but the beers were crazy popular too! We followed that up with some of their famous corn dogs which were delicious with the mustard sauce. This was only a tasting but I'll definitely be back during game days for a full order!  The event staff was super helpful and I'm really excited to go back and enjoy their puppy patio. They even set out some water bowls for the pups and the patio offered great views of people watching on the beautiful day. Luckily it was an off day for the Giants so the traffic wasn't too bad but the area was still crawling with people dogs and of course Pupcrawlers. I had a great time!  Food: 9/10  Service: 10/10  Price: $$  Atmosphere: 9/10"", ""So we stopped by Public House before the Giant's game. It was a good spot to grab a few beers and food before the game with some friends. We started at the bar and then sat at a table before heading into the game:  Beer-4 stars The beer selection is very good. They have several beers on tap as well as some unique bottled beers. Between our party we had a few Sierra Nevada Torpedoes ($7) a Stella ($6) two Chimays ($10) and a German Dunkel ($14). The only reason I cannot give 5 stars is that everything was overpriced.   Food-3 The Italian sausage with peppers and onions ($12) was very flavorful. My wife enjoyed the romaine salad with lemon-anchovy dressing ($7) and said the dressing was tangy. The house made chips ($3) were good but cold and soggy in the center. Expected them to be hot.  Service-2 Our table server was a four. He was friendly attentive and helped explain some of the more unique beers on the menu. The bartender however needs an attitude check. There are two bars in the restaurant and apparently they do not have the same beers on tap (yet the menu does not specify). The Sierra Nevada Torpedo was on tap at a different bar. When we first ordered a beer the bartender went over to the other bar to grab the beer. However when another member of our party ordered the Torpedo the bartender rolled his eyes and said if we wanted that beer we needed to order it from the other bar. Really? Not only was her rude but perhaps PH shouldn't put beers on their menu if you cannot order them. OK I am off my soapbox. Other than that the service was fine.  Decor-3 There are plenty of seats and tables to enjoy a drink and a snack before the game.""]","[""If you are looking for a place to watch Giants games it doesn't get much better than this. As sports bars go this is about as good as I've seen. Walls of kegs flat screens everywhere you look about 2 million beers on tap...what more could you want.   Before and after the game it gets extremely packed with very little chance of getting a table. The layout with two bars creating almost a funnel near the entrance isn't the best for traffic flow. That aside there is nothing better then cheering for the Giants with 200 other people all packed in tight.   The beer selection here is outstanding. They have beers that I've never sen on tap anywhere! For example North Coast Brewing Co Rasputin a beer that will put hair on your chest. They also know how to pour Guiness here. I always use that as a judge of the bar. Inside the park they will ruin your $8 Guiness with an awful pour letting the specialized spigot submerge in the beer like they are trying to drown it. At the Public House they start with the proper angle fill it up 3/4 let it sit (very agonizing) and then top it off resulting in the perfect pour."", 'at&amp;t west wing attached...grand pub and towering wall of kegs...multiple screens all around...ole ole ole ole...two-thousand-ten fifa world cup...korea two:zero win over greece!..be the reds!..argentina one:zero win over nigeria...eleven:thirty am england versus united states of america...public house packed...scouts sent in early to reserve a large table...extensive beer menu...mostly north of $seven for mini-goblets of beers...quite expensive...bar orders only...guinness seemingly the most reasonable...being served in standard sixteen-ounce glass...bartender rejecting serving guinness on busy day...bartender substituting with a mini-goblet of dark potent stout...too crowded and too late to go back and think over selection...drinking mini-goblet of beer...munching mijitas food from next door....england up by one...united states scoring a weak goal to tie the game...resulting in a tie final....']","[""So much better than Mijitas next door.

To start off with I've never been to Acme Chophouse but Public House is a much better choice for Giants games because of the pricing; much more affordable. I was a bit annoyed that even though our friend was inside with a table they still made us wait in line outside which didn't make a lot of sense.   We ordered the Chicken Sandwich Philly Cheesesteak Beef Sliders Chopped Salad Nachos and Kracker Jax. The Cheese steak for $10 or $12 was delicious according to my friend. For $9 you can also get one inside the ball park which is oily and very little meat which makes this sandwich a great deal. I had the chicken sandwich and it had fig compote and when blended with the chicken which was salty it was a perfect combination of salty and sweet. You could taste the different flavors it offered. The beef sliders I only had one was also very delicious; juicy tender hot well made. The nachos salad and the kracker jax were very disappointing. The latter stuck to your teeth before you can chew it the salad was over priced and small and the nachos while not too expensive just was too small and perhaps a bit innovative for ball park food. On the bottom was a large chip or crunchy pita bread and on top of it were nachos. I most likely wouldn't get the latter three.   Our waiter was a nice and friendly guy but either he had too many tables to manage or he was off doing something because it was often hard to find him.  For the price of food and beer this place offers a good value when compared to the food inside the park.

My dining mien was further upended by unwanted conversations to my left (an impromptu gathering of the NRA) and right (one grindingly loud professor emeritus windbagging his detailed personal financial accountings to all who didn't care to hear.)  Also it may not be super-fair to judge a place on vegetable curry. Birds-Eye in a bag meets a fez-shaped rice plop -- what was I thinking?? Should have gone straight to chicken. Or beef!

The ""mango"" in this dish was in the sauce I assume so don\'t expect to get what you\'d see at Aqua or Banana Leaf.  - Green Curry Chicken: the flavor was good and the chicken was tender.

No.  This place has very mediocre to subpar flavors. My pad see-iew was extremely bland was about 65% vegetables to rice noodle and needed to be mixed a lot when I got it. My friends had the Panang curry and they also felt majorly suckered. I think my friend said she would pay $4.00 for a dish of this quality.  There has to be better Thai food for Philly's sake! I chose one star because I would never choose to go back to this place not at $10 per entree.""]","[""le sigh...my search for authentic delicious Thai food in Center City proper continues.  There isn't really too much to say about this place aside from the fact that the decor is very pleasant.  I wasn't feeling particularly adventurous when I ate there so perhaps if I had ordered something exotic like the pumpkin curry I would have been more impressed.  I ended up going for the Thai salad with sesame-ginger dressing as an app. and good ol' Pad Thai for my entree.  The Thai salad was...bizarre.  It looked like a greek salad (iceburg lettuce cucumbers red peppers) without olives.  No peanuts and really no Thai flair to speak of whatsoever...dressing was good but salad felt like something I would get at a take-out pizza place.    The Pad Thai was fine.  Slightly mushy but I'm never one to complain about a big plate of noodles.  It was just sortof...there.  Nothing spectacular.  Friend got summer rolls with tofu and General Thai chicken.  The summer rolls were beautifully presented but stuffed with romaine lettuce.  What happened to the vermicelli noodles?  Thai chicken was tough and oddly breaded.    Save your money...go to Tamarind Smile Cafe or the Little Thai Market in the Reading Terminal instead."", ""Took 70 minutes to come and they got the order wrong so the vegetarian had nothing to eat.

The restaurant wasn't THAT busy only a few patrons so service wasn't incredibly slow. I had Pineapple juice to drink and sweet and sour chicken as my meal which was ok.

My fears were quickly put to rest after I ordered one of the best cocktails of my life. I can\'t remember the exact name but it began with a P and was a martini with cilantro in it! heaven. The drink alone was enough to earn this place an ""a-ok"" rating but then we got our dishes and the pumpkin curry was equally delicious. We also tried the green curry which was a solid dish. The service was quick and really friendly and the place was clean and bright but honestly it could have been a dump and I would still return for that cilantro cocktail.']","[""No one knows about this place but it is such a sweet little restaurant.  I think they just redid it but last time I was there there was a dining room in the front and a dining room in the back. The latter room had vines all along the wall and ceiling and they made it looks very much like a warm climate.  I've been here about 4 times under old ownership and every time got the same thing (it is a sure bet). Mango chicken entree and the mango sticky rice as dessert.   If you know mango sticky rice you will love their version here: it is black and super sticky.  I must note that when I came here last it was under new management and I got sick the day after.

Very fresh basil and mint in there and the dipping sauce is wonderful.  Fabulous Thai iced tea mango chicken is very nice; and the curries have the right amount of heat.  Don't get the beef salad; the beef's on the tough side (I've given it many chances).  Make sure you finish off with the sticky rice and mango as a dessert; it's a favorite.

On less than perfect weather days the plastic see-through tarp provides ample protection from rain and cold and the heat lamps work fine (though it's better to sit right next to them).  As a bar the few times I went it was just ok.  I went once for dinner and it took forever to get a server to seat me and the food was not as good as its brunch fare.  I went a few times to watch a couple of football games and I think I prefer other bars in the area (in terms of size of TVs beer selection seating space atmosphere etc.).

After sitting at the bar with not even as much as an acknowledgment from the wait staff - we went down to Senart's instead.  Talk about a difference.

It's average in a lot of ways and not very interesting or exciting but the food's good enough (brunch stuff burgers etc.) the beer selection's more interesting than you'd think and other restaurants nearby have long lines when the market's hopping.

Their specials change quite a bit but I think on Tuesday/Thursdays it's half off Makers Mark or something ridiculous like that. Bourbon rocks anyone?   I haven't tried enough of their normal food to say yay or nay. Burgers and wings I've had for dinner have been good but nothing super memorable (and not as cheap as I would like but this is Emkt area).

Only doing so builds up quite an appetite and walking by the various food stands never helps the hunger pangs so my first time here it was off to Tunnicliff's we went.  A multi-floored Irish bar packed with people was already a good sign even it if meant the wait was to be a little long.  Though the outside tables were perfect for people watching the humid weather forced us to get a table inside near the bar.  The place was hoppin - groups upon groups of semi-drunkards were wolfing down heaps of brunch grub with all of the fixins any comfort foodie would want.  After waiting for a good bit the food finally arrived.  What was presented was a good sampling of some of the best brunch variety on the menu:  the infamous crab cake benedicts breakfast burrito potato and cheese stuffed omelette and breakfast sandwich.  For the most part everything was decent but hardly impressionable for the experienced bruncher.  The breakfast burrito was a tad on the small side the stuffed omelette was hearty but the crab cake benedict stole the show.  They were moist flavorful and delicious.  It will be my go-to dish for all future visits.  What was off about the place was the service.  Long waits were endured for drink refills food orders and check requests even after a semi-long wait to get seated.  They certainly weren't the friendly bunch of wait staff presumably too busy considering this was the ever-popular weekend brunch service.  Since locals swear by this place I'd probably give this place a shot again down the line - be it for brunch or as a neighborhood bar.  But the next time I'll spend a little more time in the market.""]","[""I've totally been on a weekend brunching kick lately and I had the fortune of joining some lovely friends for an early* bite to eat at Tunnicliff's this past Sunday.  It was miserable cold dreary and wet out and I'd arrived at the Eastern Market Metro a good half hour ahead of our 1000 meeting time so I briefly wandered Eastern Market  before heading across the street to Tunnicliff's.  I'm not sure if it was because of the weather or if it's a regular setup but they have a tarpaulined enclosure just outside their door with seating for maybe 20 people with mounted heaters to ward away the chill.  I think I would have enjoyed dining out here listening to the rain patter off the tarps but there were number of smokers which  I wasn't so thrilled about.  Like many other Yelpers have indicated the crab omelet is absolutely the way to go here.  It's gigantic and could readily feed two not-so-hungry people or one starving person (say me).  The egg was fluffy the crab meat was large and chunky the Hollandaise was creamy and the cheese was -just- melting.  I couldn't ask for a better way to have a late breakfast!  I downed a couple cups of coffee but some of my dining companions got an early start to the day with various beers on tap.  It is a tavern after all.  My one beef was that service was noticeably sparse.  I don't know where our server would wander off to or if she was also working a number of tables up front but she was barely around at all.  Definitely plan for an easy hour-and-a-half to two-hour brunch here.  Either the kitchen is absolutely tiny and can't handle the throngs of people or the servers are off taking naps.  Good thing the food here was superb...  Conveniently one can wander around and explore Eastern Market after a totally satisfying meal at Tunnicliff's to burn off some of the calories too!  *You won't want to arrive any later than 1030 on a Sunday.  I had been waiting when they opened at 1000 and the place was absolutely packed within 45 minutes.  Good indicator that it's a well-loved local joint."", ""Instead of complying with Facebook's ridiculously obnoxious doppelganger week (seriously girl?  you REALLY think someone mistakes you for Vanessa Hudgins?  did that same person convince you to a naked photo shoot as well?) I had my own doppelganger moment when I visited Tunnicliff's Tavern and ordered a Starr Hill IPA.  Immediately I was no longer in DC but rather in gorgeous Charlottesville VA throwing back beers with a bunch of other idiotic dudes caps on backwards relishing in my life of gainful opportunity at the expense of everyone around me.  Now that I think about it maybe believing you are Vanessa Hudgins isn't so bad.  It might be a better fate than temporarily resembling a UVA frat boy.    Doppelgangers aside Tunnicliff's is a chill place in Eastern Market to have a couple of beers with your friends.  A nice long wooden bar with ample space complements the myriad of tables in this unsuspectingly large building.    Like Stoney's in Logan Circle (same group owns that bar) they have a small but interesting rotation of beers.  While I would love to tell you that the super grilled cheese is the same as the one at Stoney's it simply isn't executed the same.  There appears to be less butter less cheese and less bacon.  Having said that the 2 Pigs in a Blanket appetizer was awesome.  Melted swiss cheese is buried deep in bacon wrapped mini-hot dogs all served in potato buns with a generic mustard dipping sauce.  I would definitely order that again on a subsequent visit.    This is a good weekday spot.  So long as you understand that this is not a destination spot but rather a happy neighborhood bar then you are most likely going to have a good time.  If you don't temporarily have an out-of-character experience as a result of drinking a Charlottesville-based IPA life is even better.  Go here if you are in the Eastern Market and you are looking to hang out with your friends in a comfortable setting for a couple of hours."", 'Well I finally sated my craving for Tunnicliff\'s Tavern\'s ""infamous"" crab omelet this past Sunday.  It was every bit as good as all the other reviewers mentioned.  It definitely was choc-o-bloc full of chunks of succulent white crab meat.  So it should be for $12.00 (and two bucks extra for toast).  I\'m not sure if mine had the hollandaise sauce unless it was inside the omelet.  I did not eat every bite but  I made sure to find every last piece of crab!  My friend had the Farmer\'s omelet which her colleague who lives on the Hill highly recommended.  It contained mash potatoes melted cheddar bacon and sour cream (Her toast was included). It was $10 and I think she\'d recommend it to non-crab lovers.  Service was top-notch or if I may  mimic our server and call it ""brilliant"".  He checked in on us frequently even though business was not quite bustling at the time.  Do what we did and arrive when they open at 10:00am.  The place was starting to fill up as we left to stroll the Market right outside the front door.  This is a great place to dine if you\'re planning to shop around at Eastern Market however if you are a serious antique shopper you may want to do the market first.  Afterall the early bird catches the worm!']","[""Tunnicliff's is always a solid option for lunch or a quick dinner and drinks.  The prices are reasonable the food is good pub food; their burgers are consistently pretty good and I really enjoy the buffalo chicken sandwich.  The black and blue burger is particularly good when it comes to burgers.   The outdoor seating is a great thing to have as an option in the Eastern Market neighborhood   Bottom line:  good drinks fair prices good pub food and reasonable service."", ""This was a great place to have the Yelp Elite after-party.  The wait staff was really patient with us as we rolled in with quite a few more people than we told them in the beginning.  They did an excellent job gaging when to come and check in for new beer and food.  They knew not to hover over us and just let us be (you know you don't like that server that constantly interrupts all of your conversations with the fifteen people at your table).  They had a mean spicy buffalo chicken sandwich that I truly enjoyed.  The whole meal was thoroughly delectable.  The beer selection was pretty good and they had some nice late night specials.  I can't remember the details but I do remember being nicely surprised.  I would definitely come back and eat here if I was in the area.  Four stars for being a great place."", 'I was out in DC for business.  It was late and this pub is just around the corner from our office.  I was walking down the street I mobile yelped and it came back with some good reviews so we headed in.  My colleague had the black and bleu burger which he thought was great.  I had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and fell in love.  It was spicy it was huge and it was juicy.  I cannot wait until my next trip out to DC...just to get another one of these bad boys.  Oh yeah beer cold they have TVs yada yada yada...typical better neighborhood E. Coast pub but damn that sandwich was great.    Oh one other note for you folk..there were a bunch of families outside on the patio so it seems a good place to take the kids after soccer practice or the likes.']","['Really enjoyed the dijon salmon which was very reasonable priced for bar food and with a nice crispy exterior and a tender interior. Good selection of beer too!', 'Continually on the hunt for a good brunch I spent a beautiful Sunday morning with a few friends at Tunnicliff\'s opposite the bustle of Eastern Market.  I\'d been once before for a pleasant but unmemorable drinks/dinner but the Farmer\'s Omelet (mashed potatoes bacon cheese onions topped in sour cream) might prompt a return visit. The breakfast burrito french toast and bagel with smoked salmon were also ordered at my table and all looked worthy.  The service was workmanlike and the food unpretentious (Q: ""What kind of bagel comes with the salmon?"" A:""Plain jane.""; Q: ""Do you have iced coffee?"" A:""Well we have coffee and we have ice."") but it was relatively inexpensive and unrushed.  Certainly deserves a try if you\'re in the area.', 'The dijon salmon with stella is great!']","[""I read somewhere about a solid reuben here and that's pretty much what it was. Not something worthy of the hallowed halls of new york but as a post work grab a few beers and hang out spot it does the trick.  They happy hour isn't super great but the wings are half off after 7 and the bleu cheese that came with them was the real deal and really made a difference in terms of having sort of w/e wings and having some pretty good ones"", ""Instead of complying with Facebook's ridiculously obnoxious doppelganger week (seriously girl?  you REALLY think someone mistakes you for Vanessa Hudgins?  did that same person convince you to a naked photo shoot as well?) I had my own doppelganger moment when I visited Tunnicliff's Tavern and ordered a Starr Hill IPA.  Immediately I was no longer in DC but rather in gorgeous Charlottesville VA throwing back beers with a bunch of other idiotic dudes caps on backwards relishing in my life of gainful opportunity at the expense of everyone around me.  Now that I think about it maybe believing you are Vanessa Hudgins isn't so bad.  It might be a better fate than temporarily resembling a UVA frat boy.    Doppelgangers aside Tunnicliff's is a chill place in Eastern Market to have a couple of beers with your friends.  A nice long wooden bar with ample space complements the myriad of tables in this unsuspectingly large building.    Like Stoney's in Logan Circle (same group owns that bar) they have a small but interesting rotation of beers.  While I would love to tell you that the super grilled cheese is the same as the one at Stoney's it simply isn't executed the same.  There appears to be less butter less cheese and less bacon.  Having said that the 2 Pigs in a Blanket appetizer was awesome.  Melted swiss cheese is buried deep in bacon wrapped mini-hot dogs all served in potato buns with a generic mustard dipping sauce.  I would definitely order that again on a subsequent visit.    This is a good weekday spot.  So long as you understand that this is not a destination spot but rather a happy neighborhood bar then you are most likely going to have a good time.  If you don't temporarily have an out-of-character experience as a result of drinking a Charlottesville-based IPA life is even better.  Go here if you are in the Eastern Market and you are looking to hang out with your friends in a comfortable setting for a couple of hours."", ""The first time I walked by Tunnicliffs I thought the place was getting raided there were so many cop cars outside. Now that I live here my hypothesis is that this is just a local bar where the cops occasionally hang out.   I live right up the street and this is a great place to meet up with people after work for a drink or hell if you just want a drink by yourself and not look like an alcoholic. Their specials change quite a bit but I think on Tuesday/Thursdays it's half off Makers Mark or something ridiculous like that. Bourbon rocks anyone?   I haven't tried enough of their normal food to say yay or nay. Burgers and wings I've had for dinner have been good but nothing super memorable (and not as cheap as I would like but this is Emkt area). It's like SB said I don't come here in association with Eastern Market (Tunnicliffs brunch is nothing to write home about).   Tunnicliffs always has awesome service. The bartenders are sarcastic without being surly. They're attentive enough but not annoying.   You'll always be perched next to someone interesting from the neighborhood if you sit at the bar. It's a great mix of ppl (young and old! no weird I'm-being-hit-on-by-married-men thing here *ahem*Georgetown*ahem*) People are actually FRIENDLY in Tunnicliffs. It's utterly bizarre.

First let me say when I contact an establishment about about group reservations it's when I get my first impression if I want to eat stay or go to that particular place. I am very much about Fantastic Welcoming customer service. So when I contacted their General Manager via email he replied and was very welcoming to having our group come for dinner so I decided to keep our reservation. I also said I could not give an exact count as our RSVP's flexuate but he said do not worry about that we will accommodate any size group you bring. So all correspondence up to our arriving was answered and I was always assisted that's good service.  Upon our groups arriving we sat at the bar it's not too big but the bartenders were very helpful in assisting us with our drink orders. I was not sure what I wanted and so the bartender asked if I like Martini's and of course I do. He suggested a Cucumber Martini and I said go for it.

Our calamari appetizer was so-so but it came quickly and satisfied our grumbling stomachs. For dessert we ordered the house ""kustard"" which when arrived was huge! Like a goblet of cream...MMMMM. Also the MacGyver in me realized that I could place the rest of this ""kustard"" in my little brother\'s childrens cup. Which I did. On the way home I had my custom ""kustard"" shake! MMMMMM! Definitely WILL return! Fast service and really REALLY pretty and informative menu! Which means pictures for EVERYTHING!', 'I wish I had come here on a day that San Francisco isn\'t raining or cloudy because the view of the Piers and Alcatraz would have been outstanding. But I still thoroughly enjoyed my experience here even though some menu items were a bit pricey.  My boyfriend and I came here with two international students after a long day of touring around San Francisco\'s landmark locations. It\'s somewhat initially deceiving walking by this retro-glitzy-looking restaurant; my first thoughts were that this restaurant would be decked out and upscale. To my surprise it looked like a fancier version of Mel\'s Drive-In: decorations such as old-fashioned photos and paintings tiled counters along the walls black cloths as our napkins and menu items such as fish &amp; chips clam chowder etc. Don\'t let these retrograde items fool you! The menu items sound mediocre but WOW they did not taste like that.  The four of us ordered these items: - chicken and chips  - prix fixe 1: cup of clam chowder salmon in a spicy tomato cioppino sauce and house-made kustard ice cream (vanilla) - prix fixe 2: cup of clam chowder crab alfredo (with linguini pasta) and house-made kustard ice cream (vanilla) - wild strawberry Italian cheesecake - chocolate fog (basically a chocolate rum-like concoction with Godiva shot and a hint of mocha flavor) (Items we didn\'t order but were customarily included were water and sourdough bread &amp; butter.) We were all very pleased with each of the items we ordered--everything tasted above average. But I\'d definitely highlight a few items in particular.  HIGHLIGHTS: chicken &amp; chips Having had a crab/shrimp cocktail snack from Fisherman\'s Wharf earlier I was in the mood for something not as seafood-y. I thought the chicken and chips would be a simple strips and fries dish but WOW was I so wrong! It was a single long strip of deep-fried chicken but didn\'t taste like the typical heavily-battered dry chicken. It was juicy tender and SO delicious! I\'m not sure how I can even describe how pleasantly surprised I was to taste chicken like this! The chips were also delicious--it tastes like those flash-fried addictive fries that you\'d eat on cruises (as my boyfriend put it).   HIGHLIGHTS: crab alfredo I had enough crab for the day from snacking at the Wharf but this dish made me happy to have more especially because of the linguini pasta. I don\'t believe I\'ve ever had linguini pasta with texture to this perfection before! I love cheese from alfredo sauce to death so looking back now I wish I had ordered this (with chicken or shrimp) instead of my chicken and chips. I sometimes can\'t justify to myself to order an alfredo pasta dish in a restaurant because it\'s simple enough to make at home but Oh My Gosh I want this dish again!  Other features of this place that will make me want to come back again:  PARKING:  This place will validate your parking ticket if you\'re parked in the lot right outside it (2 hours off if you parked there before 6 pm and 3 hours off if you parked there after 6 pm). This parking lot has several employees that give out/collect parking tickets at the entrance/exit help guide traffic flow and direct you to open spots so it was extremely easy to park (minus the usual Fisherman\'s Wharf tourists that crowd the streets and walk through the lot occasionally).  SERVICE: The restaurant\'s host/hostess and waiters/waitresses are very attentive polite and easy to talk to. None of us ever had to ask for drink refills extra utensils and plates for sharing or wonder about when we\'d be receiving food. They ""properly"" served us by serving us our food on our right sides and picking up our finished plates on our left sides--classy classy! OCEAN VIEW:  This restaurant sits right next to the docks so you can get a front seat view of the bay and Alcatraz from your table. This place even chained binoculars to the window-edge counters so you can get a close up of Alcatraz and the bridges!   The best way I can describe Franciscan is casual-looking menu and restaurant with not-so-casual food quality and service. If it weren\'t for the fact that parking around the Embarcadero is so expensive and Fisherman\'s Wharf is extremely out of the way to get to I would definitely come back to this restaurant again (and even refrain from snacking on seafood around the Piers and Wharf so I can make room for food from here)!']","['My first exposure to the Louie salad was Trader Joe\'s. I love it so. Well they have a crab louie salad here for $20. I\'m thinking.. Whoa it\'s gonna be my TJ\'s salad but like SUPER good. Makes sense... I\'m paying 5 times more for it.. should have five times more.. or it should be five times BETTER right?  Oh so wrong! I was thisss close to returning my food after I saw that not only did they not toss my salad (it is a restaurant afterall they could at least do that) they put strange things I don\'t think belongs in a louie salad.. like black olives onions tomato. And sin of all sins they serve it with.. thousand island dressing!   But looking at hubby he was looking worried. I could actually see him thinking ""uh oh.. she\'s getting hungry. The monster\'s gonna come out. She\'s gonna make a scene. I\'m gonna be so embarrassed. I need to crawl underneath a hole."" So I refrained. I asked for the menu and I looked at the description to make sure that this is how THEY make a louie salad. And yeah.. even though they didn\'t call it thousand island dressing they instead listed the ingredients that make thousand island dressing. I sighed shut up because indeed it was I who are in the wrong. I should have read the description.   I hated my salad still.   Why the three stars despite the horrible food? Because hubby\'s fish and chips is pretty good. The service is good. Ambience is casual and good. I like their silverware.. and they gave me a dessert on the house (I think cause they knew their salad sucked and they knew I knew.)  Anyways would I go here again? Yes BUT gawd no on that louie salad.', 'Finally gave the Franciscan a try (after 20 years in and out of SF!). This restaurant is right smack dab on the pier and it seems to be designed like a cruise ship. We had an early dinner at around 6 and the place wasn\'t too packed--very pleasant. We were seated in the middle (not bottom) floor overlooking the bay; there was also heated outdoor seating. It was my little brother\'s birthday celebration so our group consisted of 4 adults and 3 kids under 9. Our waiter came and took our orders as I ordered the salmon (medium) cooked with the olive oil selection. Our food came quickly only after about 10 minutes ordering. Our calamari appetizer was so-so but it came quickly and satisfied our grumbling stomachs. For dessert we ordered the house ""kustard"" which when arrived was huge! Like a goblet of cream...MMMMM.

Definitely WILL return! Fast service and really REALLY pretty and informative menu! Which means pictures for EVERYTHING!', 'Crab Restaurant is what it is more like an overpriced Olive Garden..   Went there for my best friend\'s birthday in a group of 5.   Wait time on friday night we went was 30 minutes but actually 40-45 mins because the host told us that the guests that were seated on our table had the check but kept on chatting. The waiting area was right next to where the busboys cut the bread. One busboy was really friendly and offered a plate of bread and butter to snack on. I also observed another guy who was pretty clumsy and dropped the butter plate off its mantel but he cleaned well and disposed the contaminated butter away so kudos.  Its a gorgeous place I cannot lie but lacks romance in service and in the food. ESPECIALLY the food. It might have been what we ordered itself recommend ordering the seafood dinners instead of pastas and sandwiches.   Ordered the calamari platter which was really good. There was alot to go around the five of us and had a buttery flaky taste.  Most of my friends ordered shrimp alfredos chicken fettuccine; I had a crab sandwich. Two of my friends were planning to share a crab sandwich as well but was easily dissatisfied when it came out.. the sandwich looked so much smaller than what was shown in the menubook. My friend also pointed out that ""I had more fries than her""....I felt whatever about it and souped up my sandwich with a squeeze of lemon and some ketchup. The chicken fettuccine was a little dry and was sitting in oil according to my friend.  It took a while for our waiter to come by with our check although we notified him that we were in a hurry. My waiter looked like a hipster Mario not Luigi. I liked his hair though.   It was my first time here. Next time I know now to order fresh seafood such as the crab or shrimp or just get some clam chowda.']","[""I took a group of bikers (motorcycle) here for dinner in Dec. I had planned an overnight event in SF to play like a tourist. As many who have lived here all their lives had never spent the night in the city and played tourist. So I booked us hotel rooms and planned activities.  I picked the Franciscan as I like that it had a long term history was good sized to hold a group has wonderful views and of course because my favorite food is Succulent Crab.  Now you all know if your gonna eat at a nice Seafood restaurant in the city the prices are going to be a bit higher so no need for me to even go there.   What's more important is the service the food flavor and quality.  First let me say when I contact an establishment about about group reservations it's when I get my first impression if I want to eat stay or go to that particular place. I am very much about Fantastic Welcoming customer service. So when I contacted their General Manager via email he replied and was very welcoming to having our group come for dinner so I decided to keep our reservation. I also said I could not give an exact count as our RSVP's flexuate but he said do not worry about that we will accommodate any size group you bring. So all correspondence up to our arriving was answered and I was always assisted that's good service.  Upon our groups arriving we sat at the bar it's not too big but the bartenders were very helpful in assisting us with our drink orders. I was not sure what I wanted and so the bartender asked if I like Martini's and of course I do. He suggested a Cucumber Martini and I said go for it. He made me one and it was so fresh like I had just had a fresh one from the garden infused with Vodka. Yummo!  We were then seated I only had wished it were still light out so we could enjoy the wonderful bay view but that's for my next visit at lunch time.  The wait staff were quick and efficient not overly talkative but that's okay we do enough talking ourselves. All of our food was flavorful and plated lovely.   I do have to say thou I love Crab I think I said that abovecatch my drift! haha Drift and Crab in the sentence. But I really like it steamed with melted butter. So I ordered from the Pre-fixe menu what I thought read and I never looked at the menu again to see if it said it or not. But steamed Crab and when it came it was roasted Crab now I'm not saying it was bad it just was not what I had in mind and when I have something in mind to eat that is what Iwant. So roasted was a bit drier then steamed so to me not as succulent. But of course I picked the shells clean you thought I wouldn't??? The pre-fixe menu is nice you get a few entree selections soup or salad and dessert.  We had a wonderful dinner and I would go back for sure. I want to go for lunch and just take my time dining and enjoying the views. Stop in the Franciscan if you are in the city and say hi to the General Manager if he is there Craig he actually seated us that night. And get J.C. to make you a Cucumber Martini."", 'Planned a girls night out and decided to have dinner here before our gift exchange.   First thoughts as i walked in.. ""ooh this is fancy! I like!"" While we waited for our table hostess offered us to sit at the bar. Declined to overpriced drinks and sat pretty quickly. We were sat in a fairly large table with a pretty good view i liked the binoculars they provided and the cute fish spoon and forks the lighting was perfect also. Although the food was... lousy. I ordered the pre fix meal with clam chowder crab alfredo and fresh made ice cream. Clam Chowder - Tasted alright but then again tasted as if i was from a can.  Crab Alfredo- There was a fair amount of crab but the dish was VERY HEAVY the dish had NO FLAVOR i must have drenched salt and pepper in that religiously per bite. &amp; it just wasted good.  ""Make it themselves icecream""- Too sweet tastes like over sweetened vanilla.   My friend got the crab enchiladas and it tasted like straight up cheese. They added too much cheese into it that it overpowered the crab and wasn\'t good.   What was the worst part of the food there is that my girlfriends and i were like ""Can\'t finish our meal lets take it togo and eat it when were drunk later...EVERYTHING TASTES GOOD WHEN YOUR DRUNK RIGHT?"" Wrong. Tasted worse than before.   Try someplace besides this your better off at Joes Crab Shack or Bubba Gump.', 'Ok so its in the heart of Touristville But you have terrific views and I loved how bright and open the dinning area was.  As an Englishman that misses his fish and chips I have to rate it. Fries are ok but the fish is the closest I have had to the British stuff since I left there in 96. Strangely enough its catfish but it feels and tastes like buttery cod. Really light batter which is a welcome change from the inch thick usual. Ice cream harkens back to the Mr Whippy soft serve that icecream van would bring when I was a kid. Just add a cadburys flake and youve got a 99. (got to be a Brit to get that reference)']","[""As the song goes What a difference a day makes. Last week I stopped into the Francisan for lunch and was blown away from the moment I was greeted by the Hostess. She was friendly fun but most important professional. She got us a great window table making us feel soo welcome but it didn't stop there. Our waiter began our 4 hour dining experience with tasty cocktails excellent food meticulous service adding lite and fun conversation along the way! ...and as the Blue Angels were in sync when they passed the huge floor to ceiling windows it was the icing on the cake. What a great dining experience if not the best I've ever had!"", ""I was pleasantly surprised by the Franciscan. I had gone to SF for a day trip and my mom and I hadn't planned anything in advance. We had just looked at WHERE magazine and since it boasted the best crab in town we decided to ask the concierge at the hotel to make a reservation.  We walked over to pier 43 1/2 and at first didn't really want to walk in because it didn't look the cleanest. Right across from it is Boudin another seafood restaurant and it looked really nice. We actually walked over there first to check out the menu but it didn't have any crab. Sure it had crab cakes and crab sandwiches but my mom and I were really hungering for freshly steamed crab legs. So we decided to give the Fransican a chance since we already had a reservation.  Walking up the stairs the inside was loud and cheerful. We were ushered to our table right away. Everything on the menu looked delicious: we ordered a medium skillet of mussels and shrimp and a pound of crab (about 9 legs). When it arrived everything looked sooo good.  The crab legs were steamed in their garlic butter sauce but it wasn't dripping with oil. In fact it seemed like the restaurant knew just the right amount of sauce to put on to still get that great sea flavor. This was the first time I never dipped the crab in butter even though we had a cup full of it given.  With the shrimp and mussels came a reduced balsamic sauce on the side; I really urge you to try it. It tastes so good with the mussels.  I really recommend this place! It was FANtastic. My mom and I ate until we were stuffed; without eating any of the bread this was the perfect amount of food.  Can't wait to come back!"", ""Awesome awesome place.  The only clean looking place on Fisherman's wharf. I understand all the other places have been ther 100 years but it's called a mop. They're all filthy except for here.  This place is on it's own across from Boudin Bakery. You can see Alcatraz from the windows. really nice view but with 2 other guys at the table I had to hold my sentimentality.  Crab cakes = Best ever  Calamari = Not just the best ever bt one of the best dishes I have ever eaten. They have somehow made them so soft and crispy it was like eating chips. UN------INGBELIEAVABLE!!!!!!!!!  Clam chowder = Awesome. Very creamy. like a nice Greek soup.  Ceasar crab salad = Okay. I DESPISE whole leaves of romaine lettuce that I have to cut myself. At $15 it should be cut and fed to me.  Grilled octopus = Not only terrible but no taste at all. It sys a ton that we finished the 3 bean salad that accompanied it but not the octopus.  Steamed mussels = He said they were great  Oysters = They raved  Frozen custard = AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Overall I can't wait to go back. I'm not a fresh crab kinda guy but they had these huge plates with mountains of them on some tables. Looked cool.""]","[""The bulk of my points is for the ambiance and great view of the the Bay. The food was okay but in another location it would not be worth the price. I had a 3 course dinner for about $45. I started with Clam Chowder; it rich and creamy and had good flavor. My main course was Pan Seared Sea Bass served with petite potatoes and asparagus. The flavors were there but I found it to be a bit overcooked. I loved the Siren By the Sea (malibu capt. morgan's &amp; meyers rums orange &amp; pineapple juice)  It's touristy but overall but if you know what you're getting into it can be a good experience"", 'So after a long and most hectic week I found myself on a Friday night trying to decide where to dine out. I was a little tired and didn\'t want to deal with the see and be seen of the latest \'in\' place nor did I want to go someplace too simple. I did know that I wanted to dine out and that I also wanted to go somewhere different. Well after much consideration and changing my mind several times along the way we ended up here.  Years ago I had a girlfriend from Wisconsin who liked this place so I recall coming here quite a few times back then. Hadn\'t been back to eat in ages but always remembered that as far as the wharf goes it was one of the better places to dine other than Scomas.  Upon walking in I was surprised to see that the light stained blonde wood was now gone and that it had been replaced with a lot of white paint and some dashing red lighting. A little over the top but all in all I thought it worked and I actually liked it a lot better than the old decor before the remodel.  Food-wise I knew it wouldn\'t be hitting any new culinary landmarks but figured it would be a comfortable and relaxing place to eat after a long and tiring day. I ordered us a bottle of Ferrari Carano Chardonnay and also an appetizer of fried calamari. It was odd to see that bottle of Ferrari Carano since it brought back memories of my evil ex-fiancee and how we used to order that all the time. At $49/bottle it was an inexpensive yet satisfying choice which I felt was priced fairly especially for a touristy place. Only double retail or so I thought at the time.  The fried calamari was good. Wasn\'t mindblowing like what I\'ve had in Monterey or at high end restaurants but all in all it was tender and cooked nicely. As for our entrees she wasn\'t too hungry and ordered the Fish and Chips while I had the Olive Oil Oven Poached Salmon with asparagus olives rosemary and garlic. I\'ve never been a fan of olives but everything else was better than I expected.  Disclaimer: To be honest I didn\'t have the highest expectations coming in and it was actually a lot better than I had expected. I especially liked the baby heirloom potatoes with accompanied the salmon. It\'s certainly not a fancy place not by a long shot so I wouldn\'t dare compare it to the higher end places in the city but for what it is especially as a tourist place I didn\'t think it was bad at all. The salmon was cooked perfectly too.  The Fish and Chips looked good and I liked how it came on a long plate. As with the calamari I enjoyed the unusual presentation and felt that they were really trying to do just a little more to stand out. She felt that the fries were salty but I\'m a saltaholic so to me they weren\'t salty at all. As always YMMV (your mileage may vary).  Wasn\'t sure if our server was new but she and the rest of the staff that we came in contact with that night was really good especially considering that we were at the wharf. Most definitely didn\'t get the ""I\'ll treat you badly since you\'re a tourist and I\'ll never see you again anyway"" type of service that one sometimes gets in the area. I liked the \'cookbook\' style menu too. Beautiful pictures of everything and with recipes as well. The only negative about it is that because there are so many pages it was hard to cut to the chase on what to order. Perhaps an accompanying quick reference sheet might have been helpful although it worked out just fine as it was for me.  I had been rushing to get there since I knew they closed at 10PM but was surprised when I saw people get seated well after that as we were finishing up our meal so perhaps they can be a good choice for late dining on weekends.  The dessert offerings looked tempting but I decided to make it an evening of nostalgia and decided to take us to Ghirardelli for an ice cream sundae afterwards instead.   All in all it was a good dining experience. Better than I had expected and I thought really good compared to some of the other choices in the area. For a tourist restaurant at the wharf I\'d say it\'s definitely a four. Yet with that said and done when I compare it to other similarly priced restaurants in the city I just can\'t do it (give four that is). Three and a half is pretty much what it is in my book but since Yelp doesn\'t allow half stars I\'ll have to give it a three which based on my experience that evening doesn\'t feel right either. Regardless I wouldn\'t hesitate to dine here again or bring out of towners here especially if they are looking to dine in a nice relaxed environment at the wharf in pleasant surroundings.', ""First night new city what do you do for dinner? You walk around near where you are staying and find something that looks ok.  So there we are walking around fisherman's wharf crab joint here seafood joint there plus a bakery (boudin's).   We chose this place 'cos it seemed to be set away from the more central tourist area and hoped we wouldn't get 'ripped off'.   We definately did not get ripped off.  The service was fast and attentive. The food was good: lots of it and tasty.  Mrs Crash and I shared a 1/2 serve crab with 'special' sauce for appetizer. The crab was nice quite mild taste tho especially compared to our more familiar muddys. The sauce was a little weird to our taste tho' quite creamy and garlicky but not really so nice.  We had a pasta dish each for main and they were very tasty seemingly fresh pasta but both quite creamy/buttery sauces.  Sides of house salad and asparagus were great very fresh and appropriately simply prepared.  Overall for our first USA dinning experience we were impressed.""]","['order', 'order', 'order']","['sauce', 'butter', 'cream']","['wharf', 'wharf', 'wharf']","['ice', 'ice', 'ice']","['dungeness', 'dungeness', 'dungeness']","['salmon', 'salmon', 'salmon']","['olive', 'olive', 'olive']","['light', 'light', 'light']","['cake', 'cake crab', 'cake']","['asparagus', 'asparagus', 'asparagus']"

I figured this place was at least worth a try mostly just because I've walked by it so many times. After this meal I don't think I'll ever give it a second chance and I will recommend pretty much any other restaurant in the neighborhood over Apollinare.  I started with a mixed green salad- nothing fancy right? I was craving green. What I was NOT craving however was some mealy tomatoes a few shredded carrots and some over-the-hill lettuces in a sea of oil. Seriously I have never seen this much oil on anything. I'm not sure there was anything else besides oil if there was vinegar I certainly couldn't taste it. It didn't taste seasoned with salt or pepper either. By the time the server came back I'd choked down some and let her know it was disappointing- but given the poor quality of the ingredients I didn't think it would be worth getting a second less oil-drenched plate.  My date had the plate of bruschetta to start. I didn't get the impression that any of it was outstanding. I'm not even sure we could identify what each one was if that gives you any idea how lacking in flavor each one was.  For the main course I tried a pizza with mozzarella artichoke and olive. I think this pizza normally comes with prosciutto but I skipped that. I was expecting something very different: fresh mozz for one not a congealed mass of low-quality shredded cheese. Strike one. Strikes two and three: flavorless artichoke and olives- and the olives were clearly those pre-sliced black olives no good at all! Date had truffled risotto and could barely eat it. I don't think the chef used any other flavoring other than massive amounts of truffle oil- and really this is an ingredient that should be used sparingly.  After this we skipped dessert and headed next door for gelato from the newest outpost of Capo Giro.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Sorry Apollinare you've got a lot of work to do."", 'From the outside Vino appears a bit more fancy than comfy. However the inside feels precisely the opposite. Wood floors and huge TVs around definitely secure the lounge feel.  The personnel was a bit quirky. When our first waiter arrived to offer tap or sparkling water I asked what beers were on tap. He said he wasn\'t sure he\'d go check. He returned and said ""we don\'t have any beers on tap"". I wasn\'t really intrigued by the lack of draft beer so much as the nice young man\'s oblivious nature. He was so polite and nice to us though it was almost cute.  The pizzas were nothing to rave about but decent. I had the Chianti which had a delicious chianti balsamic reduction drizzled through fresh greens topping the pizza. Two noteworthy points though... Although appearing huge the pizza was thin enough that I finished mine easily and ate three slices of my girlfriend\'s. Didn\'t leave feeling full. Also the prosciutto was put on my pizza after it was already cut into slices. My butter knife and I struggled as we hacked through the perforations.  Had those pizzas been their full price ($14) I would\'ve been disappointed about the portion size. We\'ll probably head back sometime if we need something different. Otherwise it\'s just alright.', ""Vino was absolutely phenomenal.  I would have rated last night's dinner six stars if possible... definitely one of the more memorable meals I've had.  There are so many good things I could say about the night.  First off the free parking and location in the Piazza was great... very accessible and easy in-and-out.  The staff was exceptionally friendly the whole night.  The decor was so cool... huge black and white vintage portraits up on the wall under dim lighting.  They were playing a very eclectic mix of music... from Gypsy Kings to 40s big band to mellow techno music.  The tables all have these wonderfully comfortable tall leather chairs.  All this and we didn't even get served dinner yet!  We did order though... glass of house cab for me which was good; and Jill had a Stella off a surprisingly long beer list for an Italian restaurant.  I cannot recommend their bruschetta enough... it was made with a sweet bread and brown sugar on top... absolutely the best bruschetta I've ever had (Italian restaurants in Italy included).  I had their ribeye w/mashed potatoes and pom frites.  Jill had their stromboli with prosciutto ham and other tasty meats with a butternut squash dip.  The meal was out of this world.  I hope to return here again and again in the future... you certainly can't go wrong eating here yourself!""]","['This place is awful.  Let\'s see...   1.  No one waited on us for a while when we sat down... no water no bread... nothing. 2.  We got our water that we asked for FIRST about 30 minutes after asking for it.   3.  The bread (that we got about 45 minutes in...) was inedible.  Even after dousing it in olive oil.  It was dry crumbled apart and was clearly stale.   4.  One of our wine glasses was dirty with lipstick multiple spots of it... would have had to be blind not to see that.   5.  My potato/truffle raviolis looked like vomit and tasted like nothing.  They even kind of tasted freezer burned (and the waiter had made a HUGE point of telling us that everything was freshly made on premises and that\'s why it takes so long to get the food out)...And we had NO SALT on the table to even try to make it better. 6.  My boyfriend\'s supposed ""Marguerita"" pizza looked and tasted like an overly-parmeseaned Red Baron frozen pizza.   7.  Even the bathroom was awful.  It was dirty the garbage can was overflowing and people had just given up and started throwing garbage all over the floor.    Bad service can be compensated for by having amazing food but this place was terrible all around.  Do not go here!  There are a million places that are better in the area.', ""Awful! Vino was fine the way it was - what happened? Went there on a Sunday night when it was empty.

I ordered the spinach tortellini yet what they gave me was 5 tiny raviolis with 2 pieces of wilted spinach drenched in a heavy heavy olive oil. I couldnt eat it. My husband ordered the pork tenderloin. He specifically asked if the portions were a good size bc if not he'd order a side of pasta. The waiter said I do not recommend a side of pasta bc frankly our portions are on the large side...no joke those were his exact words...when his entree came out there were 5 tiny pieces of meat (about the size of a Susan B. Anthony coin) a tiny blob of some type of starch and beets. Even the beets were awful! How can you mees up beets! My mother in law had the lasagna which was okay not awful but nothing to get excited about.   Overall there are plenty of other places to go to dinner in Northern Liberties - save yourself and just don't go.""]","[""our service was great and the food was okay but not the most well polished meal.  and before i even start with our meal i have to say apollinare is way over-charging for the wine.  i'm from ca wild horse pinot noir is NOT worth $88. you can get that crap at the grocery store in ca for $20.  and while i used to enjoy wild horse wine it was before the winery was sold to someone else.  there is better wine to be had for $88 even with a restaurant mark up.    sorry for the digression.    my pork tenderloin could have been awesome but it just wasn't executed with as much care as i would have liked.  the pork itself was a little too cooked and the pecorino fondue was the consistency of melted butter and cheese- i wish it didn't separate.  there was a giant blob of red gelatinous stuff on the rim of my plate that i think was suppose to be apart of the presentation but it just seemed like such a giant mess.  the red wine poached pear was good and a nice complement to the pork though still had quite an alcohol taste to it. my husbands osso buco was fall off the bone tender but bland compared to other preparations of the same dish elsewhere. considering the price of the pork and osso buco though ($16 and $18) those dishes are not the reason for the 3 star rating instead of 4; it's because of their dessert.  we decided to order their famed award winning La Crescionda; a chocolate cake with the consistancy of bread pudding that is $13.  it was served with a small strawberry and vanilla gelato.  completely underwhelming and over-priced.  it needed more strawberries. the cake on it's own is bland but is a whole other dessert when eaten with the strawberry.  the gelato was nothing special.  and to give it scale mario batali's mozza makes exquisite desserts and doesn't even charge that much for it. while it's a nice place to sit in the piazza the food still needs a little help as does the price scale.  some dishes are a good value while other items are completely over-priced.""]","[""I guess three star reviews are my thing today. I went here for dinner last night with my two friends and it was pretty much what i expected it to be. The restaurant originally opened with a different Italian concept when the piazza had its grand opening last year but presumably due to poor customer turnout it was reconceptualized and reopened as Apollinare. My eggplant app was delicious and well prepared. I am very particular about eggplant (who isn't it seems) and this was very nicely done no bitterness only tender strips of eggplant layered with tomato sauce and cheese. One fellow diner ordered the bruscetta which were a bit interesting: the slices of bread were bigger than i had anticipated and they were all different one was topped with chopped cherry tomatoes one with olive oil one with pureed asparagus and white truffle oil and the last with arugula and white truffle oil. I ate the arugula one and it was v good.   For mains: two of us ordered the taglialini pasta with lobster which was nice but a little plain. The pasta could definitely have stood to be cooked in a light seafood stock as it was it seemed just lightly dressed in butter. The other diner ordered the seared large prawns which was quite a spectacle (done table side) and the resulting sauce from this was actually quite delicious. desserts were also very nice - good tiramisu and a very nice chilled whipped yogurt with strawberry coulis. I would return but I am not typically looking for Italian food in Northern Liberties. But if you are having a woolie this place is head and shoulders better than Il Cantuccio.   And I'm half asleep since the damn olympics are killing my sleep schedule so I hope this made sense to y'all....""]","[""I've been here a few times before but wont be going back again. I've given this place a chance on many occasions normally i would split my time between the bar and a table but since the younger guy I think the head bartender? and Simone left i just cant find myself to sit at the bar those two were great made it feel like they've known you forever. So i decide to sit at a table this past saturday and it all went downhill from there. Their servers were never really their strong point they were slower  knowledge was ok but i couldnt really get past some of their accents. The food is also always changing lasagna and federico were my go to choices now the federico looks like it came out of a bag and the lasagna is either soup on my plate or burnt my girlfriends ossobucco was ok but it tasted like it spent 10 minutes in a microwave.  I'd agree with many people on here this place WAS good in the late summer and fall but not anymore. If they want people to start coming in again they need a serious revamp and bring Simone and that younger guy back they were awesome.""]","[""Awful! Vino was fine the way it was - what happened?

We requested a couch seat with all the pillows in an alcove to the side. It seems that you can reserve it ahead of time if you wish. The layout was about half low tables and half standing and bar seating. There was also a downstairs with a separate bar that can likely be booked for parties and events.   As expected they had a hefty campaign section on the drink menu both by the glass and by the bottle as well as specialty cocktails and wines. I think you can safely assume a full bar if you have a particular drink preference.   Service was very good and the cocktails were strong and tasty. It was quite overprices and a minimum on $15 a glass across the board.They also had a stage and sound equipment - I was not there for any live music or show but it is something to keep your eye out for.   The area is an odd place to find a decent bar so based on location I say the place is worth a try if you want something upscale or are going an a date and have a slightly thicker wallet.', ""This is an interesting lounge as its main cocktails are champagne infused.  Its an interesting place  but the drinks were a little weak for 15 dollars each.  Ive wanted to try this place for awhile and was a little underwhelmed with the place.

Of course the decor is gorgeous:  candlelit with plush couches for lounging.  Another plus?  They had a live jazz band last night.  I was thrilled to listen to the talented musicians as I enjoyed this new ""favorite spot"" in the Flatiron district.  As for the drinks...Having discovered a love for Kir Royale\'s I was thrilled to see a variety of them on the menu.  Of course the classic...but upon the recommendation of the bartender (or is the PC term mixologist now?) I sampled the Violet and Elderflower versions.  Both were delicious.

I was so impressed with the intimate setting and for being a Champagne bar what more can you ask for?  Word of advice- this is a great place to bring a girl on for a date on Thursdays- Sunday because they play music and there's more people.  If you plan to go on these days be sure to call and make a reservation for a table.    When you walk in it's lavish with red lighting heavy drapery and comfy couches.  Imagine this with a swank dj pretty sexy!   I highly recommend the Champagne Mojito. Why? -- It's huge for a great price and all you need is two and you're pretty much a step pass buzzed!   I've came here millions of times and now that I'm not in NY I miss it dearly.  There is another location in NY Midtown if you're looking for a place to hide out with a someone you have on the side ( when you go here you'll understand).  There's also another Champagne bar Bubble lounge in Tribecca and in San Francisco.

I was totally satisfied with everything I tried from the sparkling sake (don't get too excited by the $17 dollar price tag - its the size of a bottle of heineken) to the rose champagne to the flight of kir royale that I sucked down in about fourteen seconds.

The last two times I\'ve been there (over the past week) the servers (two different ones) gave me and my friend the bill and it was wrong. When we inquired we were met with ""what are you talking about?"" blank stares...looked at like we were crazy and it took a few back and forths to get the bill altered....see we had wine during happy hour should be 2 for 1 but bills were more than double what they should have been.  The first time it happened I wrote it off but when it happened again last night and I asked about it and then was treated snobbily as the server huffed off and changed the bill I got a feeling this was somewhat intentional.  Won\'t be going back because I don\'t like people who play games like that. You\'re in the service industry you should know better.

You get off at Union Sq. and float towards your destination; you meet some of your friends at the entrance they have also been summoned by this ethereal little music. A spawn of Paganini's violin it is not but the simple product of a magical Flute.  Enter the dark and intimate space and listen to what your Pied Piper has to offer; sitting in your couch at a cozy enclave curtains drawn for privacy. A sprawling list of champagne options from your $20-30-40 standard do-re-mi to a $2000 Krug '79 fa sostenuto.... Then order some Petrossian smoked salmon or some Satori tuna tartar with mint avocado to indulge the rest of your primal craves. You can veer off to cocktail land and try their Champagne Mojito or Green Kimono (melon Martini w/sake) and pair them with delicious chocolates which your Flutist has brought from la maison du chocolat. Sleep. Through the haze of the hypnotic flute you will remember many things; if overly dazed ask for Harrison one of the pied piper's vassals; he will match your palate wishes with the champagne glass they deserve... He even turned one of my non-champagne drinker friends into an aficionado by the end of the night. Flute will make you do things you don't want to do; for the ghosts of Club Intime the former and famous speakeasy cabaret of the 1920's that once stood here will whisper sexy things to your ear as the notes of the night go along.   And while this may not be the cave on Koppen Hill you will find it hard to break the spell and go back to Hamelin NY.... That is until the next happy time the piper calls at 5:46 to put a temporary end to your rat race.""]","['THREE WORDS: CHAMPAGNE HAPPY HOUR.  Tuesday nights from 5-8 is their BOGO FREE Happy Hour which includes everything on the menu.. even the FOOD! I had such a great time here catching up with one of my best friends. The atmosphere is oh-so sophisticated and cozy with their private little dens and nooks dim lighting drapery comfy chairs and couches. I would DEFINITELY recommend this place to anyone looking for a classy evening of weekday drinking (oxymoron??.. you decide)   Ordered: Kir Royal which was to die for!! I went on a wine tasting tour this summer and had an excellent Kir Royal I thought I could never match - but this was definitely close. So yummy! The Antoinette cocktail.. ""A shimmering grapefruit-strawberry cocktail topped with Piper-Heidsieck Champagne"" - also delicious. Very refreshing but still maintaining a nice fuller champagne taste.   For snacks we had: Smoked Salmon Plate &amp; Cheese and Fruit Plate.. both were excellent and the perfect light treats to enjoy with champagne. Mind you this was during happy hour..SO TWO PLATES OF BOTH! so much food but you gotta love a good happy hour deal.  LOOKING FORWARD TO GOING BACK! :)', ""So I came here for my birthday a year and a half ago and have been a few times since. I'll say this..it's a really cute place and I love Gramercy and champagne bars so my review might be a tad biased.  The decor is sexy with perfect lighting seductive drapes and plush seating. It's definitely a classy place that makes you want to flirt with your date all night in a coy I can't wait to get you home kind of way which makes it a perfect date spot.   Drinks are a tad on the expensive side of things so you have to go with an open mind and open wallet. Their champagne cocktails are creative and fruity - a wonderful combination! The mojitos are amazing and very dangerous! You don't realize how much alcohol is in them and they're so divine that you can't help but kep drinking. The antoinette is also a good choice...something about the tartness of the grapefruit just leaves you craving more.   It's the perfect place to end or start out your night. It's classy elegant and if you drink the mojitos you'll definitely get a good buzz going. The only con was that the place got ridiculously crowded."", ""Nice Atmosphere Great Service and super yummy drinks.  Definently somewhere to go with a group of friends to chill.  Prices on the drinks aren't THAT expensive it is NYC after all.  I had the Antoinette and it was so delicious (grapefruit strawberry and Champagne!) mmmmmmmmmm.......  They have a large selection of Champagne and Sparkling white wines.""]","['There are several classic parings with Champagne: Champagne and caviar. Champagne and eggs. Champagne and smoked salmon. Champagne and a loud obnoxious DJ set isn\'t one of them.  To start out optimistically the high point of the evening was the NV Piper-Heidseck Monopole Brut one of my favorite champagnes for under $30 retailing here at the bargain price of $15/glass.   However I will freely admit that I probably chose the wrong day and time to stop by Flute Gramercy but it\'s hard to enjoy sipping something delicate and bubbly when you have to sign and yell like Helen Keller to communicate with the person sitting five feet from you.  On a city block with wine-centric Veritas cosmopolitan Mari Vanna and perennial classic Gramercy Tavern Flute Gramercy sticks out like that kid in your freshman year dorm that tries to hard to be cool.  The decor did not strike me as sheik but as delightfully tacky. Red plush couches evoked swanky strip club rather than sophisticated boite. Old bottles of champagne lined the ceiling shelves like empty forties in a frat house living room. And reproductions of French travel posters plaster the walls like your old dorm room college poster ""Beer: Helping White Guys Dance Since 1842."" (Although to Flute Gramercy\'s credit the display case with the empty magnums jeroboams and methuselahs was pretty impressive).  Would I take a date here? Absolutely not. There are swankier and more sophisticated joints in this neighborhood.', ""I'll have to admit that maybe bubbles is not my thing. Totally indifferent about Flute. Super-overcharged old-deco style for my taste correct service but not the friend-est and OK drinks. Agree that could be fun with a group of friends. For a date well in my opinion only if you like this kind.   The sparkling and champagne selection by the glass (flute) is good but is larger at Bubble Lounge; the price is worth for the expensive champagnes but pricey if you choose a regular one or the sparkling wines. They have in the menu some interesting Tasting Flights Magic Flute tho.    They also offer some red and white wines some beers and signature cocktails either with champagne or sparkling wine. The Green Kimono a melon-cucumber martini topped with sparkling sake was enough good. But I didn't like The Marquis de Sade consisting in Merlot orange juice and Grand Marnier topped with Piper-Heidsieck Champagne. If the ambiance would have been different maybe I should be more optimistic with the drinks.   If you are having a craving for champagne/bubbly this is one place to go. But as I said... I guess bubbles is not my thing."", ""Went with a large group for the Monday night 7-9P all you can drink with hors deurves $25 per person (includes tax and tip).  got there at 7...they would ask for the moeny first no problem.  then brought you your choice of drinks be it champagne bellinis beer wine well drinks.  They were attentive and did bring drinks as best they could for 14+ people.    Over the course of 2 hours...I got 4 rounds of rum coke.  Others I think got maybe 4 beers  5 flutes maybe.  The appetizers were ridiculously pathetic.  3 trays came around...enough for maybe one appetizer each person...so that makes 3 little morsels per person of whatever it was they served.  I couldn't tell you.  At 9..they said no more..when someone pointed it was 8:59 on their phone they gave that person a drink.    Ambience was nice and all the staff did as best they could...the male host could have look friendlier.  The female server was very nice.  All in all I wouldn't recommend the Monday night special.""]","[""Four words - Nino Franco Rustico Prosecco. That's all you need to know when going here. That's all you need to order. It's the BEST sparkling wine / prosecco / champagne (if you don't get too technical) that I've ever had. I don't like champagne. It's usually way too sweet and always gives me a headache. This however was neither sweet nor obnoxiously bubbly. I would go back to Flute just to order this.  The place was very crowded on a Saturday night and the guy at the door at first wasn't going to let us in because we didn't have a reservation. Then he said that he had a table available. Unfortunately the table was right smack in the middle of the flow of traffic and the narrow corridor from the front door through the middle of the house. When we asked to be moved because our legs were too long and we didn't want to trip people as they walked by we were graciously seated at a table in the back room.   The service here was excellent. Everyone was extremely nice and very attentive. We tried to order the chocolate cake off the dessert menu but unfortunately they were out of it. Instead they put together some kind of pear tart covered with drizzled dark chocolate and gave that to us for free on the house.   Very young demographic. The vast majority were of the 25 and under variety. Definitely not a mixed crowd."", 'Been to the midtown location before so I Knew this was a champagne bar. Cozy space great for a date or catching up with a girlfriend. Cheesy but charming vibe. Ordered chocolate cake -we didnt like it so the manager (?) sent it back for us gave us another free dessert along with 3 rounds of free champagne. Will be back!', ""I celebrated my recent birthday (I'm not a day over 25 folks ;-) at Flute Gramercy. Dacotah the event planner was great to work with. She answered all of my questions and was very helpful. We went there on a Saturday night so although they were super busy they were very accommodating to me and my party. We had a section on the lower level. Mind you I had not really checked out the lower level before. The one time I was there before I stayed upstairs. Let's just say the upstairs is WAY sexier than downstairs. Nevertheless downstairs was fine. They had some pop music going bartender was great ( waitress was new and not very helpful but she tried so props to her) and the manager was helpful. They brought out my cake and everyone sang and then they served it. All in all I was VERY happy with the service at Flute and how they helped to make my night special. I will definitely be going back. P.S.

With 600+ reviews and lines out the door this place serves amazing food with a very reasonable price tag. I am no expert on Moroccan food but I will go as far as to say that their food is universally appealing as long as you appreciate great tasting foods and well...lamb.   I have been here a few times for both brunch and dinner but this review is on dinner only.  I first came to Mogador mid-winter last year on a Friday night. With a party of 7 we waited outside in the bitter wind for 2 hours. Yes I don\'t think I have ever waited this long for anything besides rides in Disney World (and trust me that was not by choice either). With frozen fingers and a runny nose I set my bar high that few restaurants would be able to obtain but Cafe Mogador delivered.   The Lamb Tagines with Apricot and and Prunes was to perfection.   They stewed the lamb leg with the fruits resulting not only flavorful but also off-the-bone tender meat.  I love the sweet and savory combination. The dish also came with a side of cous-cous. Although I didn\'t have the honor to observe the cooking process but I am fairly certain that the cous-cous with cooked with butter/heavy cream resulting that silky finish. Combined with meat juice overflew from the tagine the cous-cous stands on its own.  We also shared the hummus with felafel as our appetizer.   Appropriately breaded and fried the felafels had just the right amount of crunch and not so much grease. The hummus was flavorful and fresh. This dish also came with one piece of hot/soft pita bread.....what\'s better than warm bread??!!!! Needless to say.....we licked the plate clean.  To offset the rich lamb tagines and the creamy felafel the Moroccan mint tea was the perfect compliment. Didn\'t think much of it when I ordered but when it came in this silver Moroccan pitcher it really wowed us and it enhanced the overall experience.   Since they do not take reservations and the lines are ridiculous on Friday nights/weekends I highly recommend coming here for weekdays (preferably between 6-7pm) with a smaller party. The portions are substantial and the food is great. For $30-35/person and I got to cross one item off my ""TO TRY"" list with a happy belly.   Best part yet Cafe Mogador is 2 steps away from Bua a great lounge across the street.   ......Friday night raging anyone? :)', 'I don\'t always give 5 stars to restaurants but when I do it\'s because they goddamn deserve it.  this place seemed really busy and jumping on a Thursday night and I was worried that my dinner date and I wouldn\'t get a seat. turns out the place is much bigger inside than it appears and we were seated right away. well as soon as I got there - lousy subway lines...  we were both starving so we ordered an appetizer to kick it off. labne/zahatar/olive oil - yogurt with spices and olive oil (don\'t worry I had to ask for a translation too) served with some pita bread. portion was small but also just shy of 5 bucks and was a good start.  I ordered the cous-cous meat combination platter. chose merguez and lamb. lamb was a huge portion of meat that fell right off the bone. Jesus Christ on a moped I don\'t think meat can even be legally allowed to be this tender. didn\'t need a knife just used my fork to pry the meat and fat off the bones...merguez was a little small but still excellent. just a hint of spice. there was a small sampling of a spicy paste that I really enjoyed but my date said it was too hot for her. ah well more for me! the meat was served atop a giant plate of cous-cous as well as a side bowl with some vegetables in a broth.  as for the girl - she had the lamb tagine platter with apricot/prune sauce over cous-cous. she enjoyed it. I refrained from sampling it...wow I really did that?! anywho she thoroughly loved it. the lamb like mine just came apart with a fork. excellent job cook!  had a drink each here. she had a lychee martini I had the ""Gold Rush"". the latter is Maker\'s Mark with honey and lemon...totally delicious.  let\'s order dessert? yes let\'s. okay let\'s try ordering one item and if we\'re still hungry order a second. first off was the pear/cranberry pastry - FRESH BAKED! yes clearly not reheated but actually made in the goddamn kitchen. trust me I can tell. it was covered in a delicious and sweet hot chocolate sauce. for dessert round two we ordered the orange/almond cake with orange sauce. soft and perfectly soaked up the sweet citrus juice.  I hate to keep yammering on but this place was amazing. prices were fairly decent - for all that we had the total (pre-tax) came to about 80 bucks. the quality was excellent portions were fair sized and the food came out quickly.

As I was perusing the menu I had a lot of questions. Luckily the waitress was very patient with me. For the appetizer we ordered the labne zahatar &amp; olive oil; the waitress explained to me as fresh bread with a yogurt sauce. Sounded and then tasted good to me. My main course was the grilled merguez which was described to me as a spicy sausage. Ok why not. My friend ordered the bastilla which has a description on the menu so he wasn't annoying like I was. I liked my dish-- it had a good flavor and it wasn't that spicy. My friend's bastilla was ok. It was a little too sweet for me and if I had ordered that I would have struggled to finish it. I'm not a sweets person.  Anyway it was a good meal and I would definitely come back if I'm craving Moroccan food.

It is a small cozy... with some communal seating in the middle (which in the winter is a freezing place to sit.)

They've got soy sausage for the vegetarians and Intelligencia coffee for the bean snobs -- don't peg Pubert as a complainer we've been known to get the soy meat and we love the coffee.  The waitresses are always fine and there's a beefy busboy so you've already got a killer staff to take care of you. The decor exudes greasy spoon but they give it a twist with holiday-specific decorations and lights. The place is lined with booths and a communal line of tables sits in the center of the room. They pack the people in and always seem busy when we go which is usually weekend brunch. Oh and in the summertime there's a great little unexpected patio and that my friends is fine.  The food is consistent and good; we usually get an egg sando or chilaquiles but they've got pretty good huevos rancheros eggs florentine and always have a clutch special. Another specific highlight is the hash browns; they do hash browns shredded and fried rather than home fries which is very necessary for a cheap-o diner. We don't want the home fries baby just the shreds.  So Sunrise is the place to be in the morning but we've got to admit here the one downfall of the place -- if you're sitting up front you will be subjected to the constant line of cars pulling into the McDonald's across the street. Sunrise can't control this little foible obviously but take that into consideration. One time we saw some dude's wheel fall off his car while pulling into Ronald's. All he wanted was a hot apple pie but his dang wheel came off. Subsequently the customers that came after him had to roll over the sidewalk to get their Quarter Pounder or whatever.

Eggplant fritter appetizer was awesome melt in your mouth goodness. Fried calamari was delicious too and well seasoned.  For entreea I think the majority of the group went with one of the two ravioli specials - (1) spinach and ricotta with pink sauce and (2) goat cheese. Both are homemade and didn't disappoint.  Sauvignon blanc was pretty good at 42/bottle.  Oh and they also threw in a strawberry tiramisu sang happy birthday and handed the girls roses on the way out which was a nice little touch."", ""Fresh house-made pasta is the hallmark of this Hell's Kitchen dining spot. Among the outstanding entrees are veal-filled tortellini fettuccine with spinach and ricotta cheese in a rich tomato sauce and linguine with capers olives and anchovies. The staff hustles to ensure theatergoers will be in their seats by curtain time. With pastas as low as $9.95 and main courses ranging from $12.95 - 24.95 this is a delightful spot that fits all budgets.""]","[""This place has expanded to three times it's original size since it opened on this Hell's Kitchen corner.  This is of course due to customer demand.  The waiters have a great fun attitude the specials are fresh (seafood ravioli is my fave).  If they like you they'll buy you a drink and get you really jolly...  Caramelized apple tart with hazelnut ice cream is the sweet I like to finish with.  Good choice for pre-theater."", ""I went here with my parents for dinner.  The calamari was lightly battered and flavorful and the caprese salad with prosciutto was great.  I had the Bucatini All Amatriciana and it was good but it didn't blow me away.  The pasta at Bar Pitti is much better.  Unfortunately I had an apple tart with vanilla gelato and it was so burnt and over done that i couldn't even cut into the phylo-like tart.  I couldn't believe a chef would even let a dessert like that out of the kitchen.  I sent it back and got the ricotta cheesecake instead.  The cheesecake was just okay.  Although light and airy it wasn't as rich and flavorful as I would have hoped.""]","[""The best rating I could ever give this restaurant is the fact that I see Italian tourists frequent it. My secret gem in hell's kitchen. I live in the hood and I needed a place to get some great Italian food near me. The service is friendly like a family. Very relaxed.  I go there for lunch and dinner often. The Pomodoro sauce is truly authentic I just get it with rigatoni and it's fantastic. Fresh basil btw. I also recommend the Brodetto with red snapper. It's a great portion with shrimp mussels and clams. The three cheese risotto is rich and wonderful and has always been perfectly cooked. It's the perfect local place for foodies in the hood to sneak off to for a few drinks or great simply prepared Italian food.""]","[""This seemed like a place with really good desserts and HO YEAH these were really good desserts -- ricotta cheese cake and tartufo gelato enjoyed on a date at a table for two in the window. Lovely. I'll come back for dinner.""]","[""This seemed like a place with really good desserts and HO YEAH these were really good desserts -- ricotta cheese cake and tartufo gelato enjoyed on a date at a table for two in the window.

The red wine selection is great!  Most of the salads are great. The spinach ravioli which they only have as a special is one of the better ones they have in the city.

We walked out feeling clean.  * DINNER: We were happy with all of our orders: red snapper casserole (a big bowl of kimchi soup with fish &amp; veggies) calamari saute with noodles braised kalbi with ginseng (an absolute must) grilled bbq chicken japche (very chewy not too oily) and white tuna salad (fresh and crispy veggies). * Both pumpkin and spinach porridges are delicious.

The restaurant should be re-titled from Korean cuisine to Asian cuisine.  The rice was rather dry.  Service was attentive.  The ambience is very intimate with lit candles as it's the only source of light which puts a strain on patrons' eyes in deciphering the menu when ordering.  There is Chinese writing on the floor for their decor which this is supposed to be a Korean cuisine restaurant?  You don't mix Asian ethnic cultures!

The equivalent of screwing up bibimbop is like screwing up frying an egg.

It\'s not the insane spicy garlicky stinky extreme food that you can get at a bona-fide Korean joint or your favorite ajumah\'s house.  AND unlike the big palace-style restaurants on 32nd St they don\'t charge ridiculous prices for simple foods that your mom can make.  Sura is however a really wonderful fusion-style Korean restaurant that anyone who loves the cuisine could appreciate -- and if you look at their web site and menu they are the first to tell you this!    Fusion or no what Sura does offer is delicious and I have gone back time and time again to order basically the same dishes.  Are you a fan of bibimbap?  If you are you know that most Korean places don\'t put a whole lot of effort into theirs and that you can do better at home (after all it\'s not hard to buy a box of gochujang and chop some vegetables).  But Sura\'s calamari bibimbap takes the concept to a whole new level.  It is definitely bibimbap but it has this smoky spicy flavor in it that is to die for and goes so well with the grilled calamari.  I\'ve never seen calamari in bibimbap but once I saw it and tasted it at Sura I was sold.  Another traditional Korean dish Sura does well is soft tofu.  True I\'ve had better and spicier soft tofu in New Jersey (and at my mom\'s house).  But the soft tofu at Sura is true comfort food.  It\'s a little less spicy than the usual soft tofu but what it lacks in spice it makes up for in flavor and fresh ingredients.  They really give you lots of tofu and egg plus a few enoki mushrooms.  They also add shrimp and calamari to the soup.  It\'s just a wonderful cold weather meal to have especially if you are sick.  Other strange and wonderful things abound at Sura.  They have another dish called ""Golden Shrimp"" that features shrimp so soft buttery and tender you\'ll wonder why all restaurants don\'t do their shrimp that way.  And odd but surprisingly good things like their cinnamon iced tea are always a delight.  Last but not least the wait staff at Sura are always very prompt and friendly and if you have a birthday dinner there they will outfit you in traditional Korean garb and snap a Polaroid of you &amp; your friends -- it\'s hilarious.   Bottom line if you are looking to try good Korean cuisine at decent prices or you want something different than the traditional Korean restaurant Sura is a good place to go.

For $9-12 (depending on which you choose) you get a soup of the day (last time: spicy miso) plus a box with an entree (beef bulgogi grilled pork short rib) a salad with ginger dressing white or multi-grain rice and a couple other sides (last time:  two pieces of california roll and these pancake-like things).    I\'ve tried the bulgogi and found it good but not great.  It\'s in a dark sauce with mushrooms and onions reminding me a bit too much like a Chinese beef dish.  Definitely didn\'t measure up to Gama\'s.  The spicy pork is better (but also not as good as Gama.  I found the quanity a bit skimpy too.  The beef bibimbap (aka Hanson\'s favorite Korean dish) is good but I would\'ve liked some more beef in the dish but otherwise it did the trick (cost ~ $9).  The chicken bibimbap didn\'t work for me - go beef or go home.  The spicy soft tofu soup ($7) lunch special has good flavor and a generous amount of tofu.  As comforting in its own way as ramen or chicken soup.  The sashimi I\'ve tried (hamachi and unagi) are solid if sliced perhaps a little too thin.

Many wearing the traditional Korean robes.  We ordered: Kimchi pancakes - more like silver dollar pancakes!  Three small sized pancakes -- but absolutely no spice/heat from the kimchi pieces.  Mango salad: chopped iceberg lettuce shredded beets &amp; thinly sliced mangos.  Tangy and sweet -- but our dinner companion remarked how it tasted like russian salad dressing.  Tofu/Vegetable saute: A bit too saucy and on the salty/black bean side.  This reminded me of a chinese takeout food dish.  Silken Tofu &amp; Seafood stew:  Came out piping hot -- lots of tofu -- but again our dinner companion remarked that there was hardly any seafood in the dish.  She even asked the waiter if this had seafood in the dish and he said yes there is squid and shrimp in the dish.   3 sojus:  Neat pineapple &amp; mango -- these were *by far* the highlight of the dinner experience.  Nicely infused the sojus really shined and at only $7/each -- probably the best items on the menu for presentation (martini glasses) balance and taste.    If not for the sojus my star rating would have been significantly lower....  Better Korean food options in the East Village....where's the fiery spice?"", ""If you like real Korean food don't go to Sura. If you like food prepared in a nice way with flavors similar to Korean food (sesame spicy red pepper paste garlic etc) then go to Sura.   I ordered kimchee tobu bokeuhm (sauteed kimchee and tofu) and the best part about it was the tofu. Boiled right but the taste was all wrong. Too sweet too syrupy and most of all the kimchee was way to vinegary.   Of course people who have rated this restaurant like the bibimbop. It is pretty darn hard to screw that up. Seriously. The equivalent of screwing up bibimbop is like screwing up frying an egg. I mean at the end of the day even if you put too much butter or oil or the egg gets a little burned it still tastes like egg.  I've had Korean fusion but this just didn't cut it. The only good thing this restaurant had was the presentation - the space is nice and decorated well and the infused sojus are cool. But the food is nothing to brag about. Even their multi-grain rice wasn't really multi-grain... it was like the ratio of white to multi wasn't right like when restaurants put water in the hot sauce.  Oh man it has been 15 minutes since I left the restaurant and I already have a MSG headache. ugh.""]","[""Sura is totally my type of restaurant.

It was silky sweet aromatic (pine nuts on top) with a thickness that one can only usually find in savory stews.  The only thing was that  pumpkin wasn't season... did it come from a can? If so where can I buy a can of pumpkins this tasty?  My friend only got the little kiddy meal of bimbipbop (that's unfortunately how I remember to spell it and say it to my Korean roommate's disapproval). He legit inhaled it I've never seen anybody eat so furiously with such determined euphoria in their eyes. I got the mackeral.  My dish was an inedible disaster. The fish was so unfresh that it tasted like I was eating spicy hooker underwear. They even told me the fish was not fresh but frozen. Blargh. And it was a pricey dish too!  Gotta say they saved themselves with their decor and good service. It's just so relaxing and plush I'd come here again... but I wouldn't order any seafood!"", ""I've had my fair share of Korean food (it's one of my favorite cuisines) over the years and I've tried a bunch of places in NYC. After sampling Sura twice in the last couple of weeks it is now my go-to spot for wholesome delicious consistently great Korean food. My Korean friend J wholeheartedly agreed and even took her mom to Sura a few days after I introduced her to it.   I can't remember the Korean names of everything I've had there but the barley tea pumpkin porridge beef stew tofu stew miso stew and dolsot bibimbap are all top notch. Their kimchi (included with any meal) isn't my favorite but Sura is perfect for a hot and hearty meal that will warm your soul and tickle your tastebuds. The super friendly service and great bang for the buck are just icing on the complimentary end-of-meal mochi.""]","[""I was navigating around MenuPages and came across what sounded like a very unique Korean restaurant.  It was located outside of K-Town and had some of the most interesting dishes I have ever come across.  While mainly sticking to tradition the culinary list was also graced by many other creative meals that piqued my hunger.  I scanned the electronic menu and began to salivate.  I quickly forwarded the link to my Korean friend who concurred that everything sounded spectacular.  We agreed that we had to make our way to Sura as soon as possible.    We wound up making our way there after a long night of barhopping and even an earlier dinner...yes we are disgusting I know.   Hey when I have a new restaurant nagging at my mind I need to fulfill my curiosity!  Unfortunately we were extremely disappointed by the quality of our meal.    Although our servers were very friendly and attentive they did not provide the usual multitude of starting side dishes.  We were merely presented with small mounds of cabbage and radish kimchi neither of which was as well-seasoned and potent as they should have been.  We started with the Pear And Pork Delight appetizer which was an elegant plate of thinly cut bbq pork layered amongst crunchy pear slices.  A glaze of chili miso soy sauce and raspberry was drizzled across the dish.  The pork was lean and perfectly cooked.  The sweet sauce was a great enhancement.  However the temperature difference between the warm meat and cool fruit was rather off-putting.  Also a Granny Smith apple would have provided a better flavor balance than the bland Asian pear.    The Dolsot-Bibimbop was the traditional crispy rice served in sizzling stone pot with various marinated vegetables and beef topped with a firm egg yolk waiting to be broken and spread throughout the bowl.  Unfortunately the beef strands were bland and even adding heaps of chili paste did nothing to kick up the flavor.   The Beef Bulgogi sirloin was thinly sliced and lean.  It was marinated in its standard sweet soy sauce but this version was overly syrupy with a tongue-coating sugarness.  Sauteed mushrooms carrot slices and a head of broccoli adorned the sizzling platter attempting to lighten the heavy meal.  The Sundubu-Jjigae - Soontofu Stew was a hardy blend of tofu vegetables seafood and egg.  The tofu was very mushy and what was supposed to be a spicy soup was just bland.  We were happy to receive multigrain rice rather than the usual white variety.  It's sticky chunks made it easy to dip into the bulgogi sauce.  Overall we found that the creative-sounding dishes failed to back their descriptions with the flavors we had longed for.  Perhaps our turned up noses could be blamed on the late hour of our arrival or our already full bellies but neither of us would opt to return to Sura.  There are just too many better meals to be had in Koreatown."", 'As there were several vegetarians in our party (myself included) we chose to eat at Sura in part after seeing the extensive vegetarian menu. For appetizers the fried dumplings were good and the mung bean pancakes would have benefited from more sauce.  However the fun begins after tucking into my veggie bibimbap when I glance across the table and see a rather large tentacle sticking out of my friend\'s ""veggie"" soontofu. Yes a tentacle.  I start poking through my ""veggie"" soontofu and discover several small squid lurking under the tofu pieces.  Another friend asks if everything is ok and upon finding out about the squid gleefully holds up a chunk of beef that he had found in his vegetables and tofu in kimchi sauce. The guy across the table notes that he has crab in his veggie udon.  We alert the waitress who promptly blames the kitchen and then asks repeatedly ""so is it ok is it ok?""  No - it is not OK. She desperately wanted us to say that we were ""vegetarians"" who in fact adored squid and octopi and delighted that we were getting free seafood. I am more like one of those ""vegetarians"" who has visions of ""attack of the killer octopus"" scenes when I see tentacles.  I eventually got a replacement for my soontofu (without seafood) although this was because I complained rather loudly.  Our waitress did not volunteer to replace any of the other dishes and did not adjust our bill accordingly even though the other soontofu and veggie udon were virtually untouched after the ""surprises"".', 'So I KNOW Sura is not ""authentic"" Korean food.  It\'s not the insane spicy garlicky stinky extreme food that you can get at a bona-fide Korean joint or your favorite ajumah\'s house.  AND unlike the big palace-style restaurants on 32nd St they don\'t charge ridiculous prices for simple foods that your mom can make.  Sura is however a really wonderful fusion-style Korean restaurant that anyone who loves the cuisine could appreciate -- and if you look at their web site and menu they are the first to tell you this!    Fusion or no what Sura does offer is delicious and I have gone back time and time again to order basically the same dishes.  Are you a fan of bibimbap?  If you are you know that most Korean places don\'t put a whole lot of effort into theirs and that you can do better at home (after all it\'s not hard to buy a box of gochujang and chop some vegetables).  But Sura\'s calamari bibimbap takes the concept to a whole new level.  It is definitely bibimbap but it has this smoky spicy flavor in it that is to die for and goes so well with the grilled calamari.  I\'ve never seen calamari in bibimbap but once I saw it and tasted it at Sura I was sold.  Another traditional Korean dish Sura does well is soft tofu.  True I\'ve had better and spicier soft tofu in New Jersey (and at my mom\'s house).  But the soft tofu at Sura is true comfort food.  It\'s a little less spicy than the usual soft tofu but what it lacks in spice it makes up for in flavor and fresh ingredients.  They really give you lots of tofu and egg plus a few enoki mushrooms.  They also add shrimp and calamari to the soup.  It\'s just a wonderful cold weather meal to have especially if you are sick.  Other strange and wonderful things abound at Sura.  They have another dish called ""Golden Shrimp"" that features shrimp so soft buttery and tender you\'ll wonder why all restaurants don\'t do their shrimp that way.  And odd but surprisingly good things like their cinnamon iced tea are always a delight.  Last but not least the wait staff at Sura are always very prompt and friendly and if you have a birthday dinner there they will outfit you in traditional Korean garb and snap a Polaroid of you &amp; your friends -- it\'s hilarious.   Bottom line if you are looking to try good Korean cuisine at decent prices or you want something different than the traditional Korean restaurant Sura is a good place to go.  There are so many dishes here that I haven\'t tried and I will definitely go back again and again to try them all!']","['rice', 'rice', 'rice']","['pear', 'pear', 'pear']","['egg', 'egg', 'egg']","['dolsot', 'dolsot', 'dolsot']","['stick', 'stick', 'stick']","['cinnamon', 'cinnamon', 'cinnamon']","['miso', 'miso', 'miso']","['saute', 'saute', 'saute']","['pumpkin', 'pumpkin', 'pumpkin']","['pear pork', 'delight', 'delight']"

As other reviewers have mentioned it really feels like you\'ve stepped inside the cramped apartment of two eclectic women who happen to be very good Thai cooks!  The seating is a melange of furniture probably picked up at garage sales or on the street--a couple of the tables are actually grade school desks!  We ordered several different things all of which were delicious and cooked to order. As such it takes a bit longer than usual to get the plates but it\'s worth the wait because everything tastes really fresh. The seafood pad thai is really light and flavorful but not drowning in heavy peanut sauce. When I took my first bite I thought ""wow this has an amazing mouth-feel"". Now I realize that it is probably cause I was asking a lot of questions to the wine guy at Blue Ribbon wine bar earlier in the day and he used that word. I don\'t think I\'d ever used it before to describe food but it works for this pad thai. The shrimp and crab in the dish are very good as well and add to the pleasing mouth-feel. The green papaya salad was wonderful and fresh and has a great kick of hot chili to counter the salad\'s crispy cool.  The BYOB adds to the homey feel although it seems like a bit of a jip to pay a corkage fee of a buck per beer since they don\'t even serve alcohol. I guess they have to deal with the bottle recycling.

The service is quick but even the staff is laughing all the time because maybe they know the food is not great I catch them laughing when there are no customers around.  The place is worse considering its overpriced and the nan especially the garlic and samosas are bland. The portions are not that big and it was watered down. Immediately after purchasing my meal I had went to another indian place because I knew it was going to be a  bad meal. Its almost as if someone made cheap watered-down sauce and quickly cooked a meal.  The mango lassi was very concentrated and little in the way of flavor also overpriced.

I understand the GC food is going to be spendier but higher prices should command a certain quality of food which Cafe Spice can\'t seem to execute.

So my girl friend and I traveled all the way here because this was the only other Hawaiian food place that we can get to without too much hassle. We've got there and realized the food was not so much Hawaiian as we thought it would be but it was rather a much Asian Fusion influence instead. This place was pretty small with about 4 or 5 tables. The ambiance was nice and simple.  I ordered the Thai Red Curry with beef that comes with rice and salad. The beef was tender and the curry was slightly spicy. But lately I've been on a spice crave...I guess I can't really call myself weak sauce any longer when it comes to spicy food. My dish was pretty good except I would like the spice level to kick it up a notch then I think it would be perfect with the hint of coconut milk.  My friend ordered the Hawaiian BBQ dish with beef. Her dish was has light soy based sauce with dice pineapples. Her dish was a combination of sweet and savory which was pretty good.  We both gotten the Apple Ginger Egg Roll and ice cream. She gotten the green tea ice cream and I gotten it with the Thai Chilli Chocolate ice cream. The green tea ice cream was pretty normal. The Thai Chilli Chocolate was chocolatey with a hint of spicy kick which was really good! The apple ginger egg roll was crispy and the apple and ginger went well together. This dessert was quite interesting with the sweetness from the apple the gingery from the ginger and the spiciness from the chilli with the sweetness of the chocolate.  Hopefully next time I get to try some more authentic Hawaiian food.""]","[""This is one of our favorite restaurants in the area. We get delivery from here about every other week and stop in from time to time also. Some people have commented that the menu is not authentic  - however all that has been americanized are the names of the dishes and the descriptions. We are huge Korean food fans and the flavor is every bit as authentic as that of the top restaurants in K-town or elsewhere.  Here are our favorite dishes:  (1) K BBeQ with beef (Kalbi) - juicy beef ribs thinly sliced over rice (2) K rice (Bibimbap) with beef (Bulgogi) - excellent Bibimbap only downside is you cannot get it in a hot pot (Dolsot) (3) K noodles (Chap Jae) with beef (Bulgogi) - perfect clear noodles (4) Scallion pancakes (Pa Jun)  I recommend sticking to these basics as it's really what this place does best. However they also do quite authentic-tasting renditions of Thai and Vietnamese dishes.  I would not describe the restaurant as a hole-in-the wall as others have - it's a cozy BYOW (not beer) space and for the tiny dimensions of the place I think they've done quite nicely with the decor. It is a family business with the owners' son (who speaks English natively) usually doing the serving and taking the delivery calls.  As a final note many businesses on 2nd Avenue are being hurt tremendously by the construction of the subway line. Buddha BBeeQ is no exception and was actually mentioned in the NYTimes article about this terrible side effect of the construction:   http://www.nytimes.com...   I strongly encourage all Yelpers to patronize the quality 2nd Avenue establishments such as this one."", ""The interior is rather quaint and the seats are a little hard but not bad.  I had the Korean beef ribs there were flavorful and tender I could of easily eaten those all night.  The portions were a little small but with a side or two that would have been solved.  It never looks crowded I hope that they are doing well as it is an alternative (both in menu selection and just a different place) to the other Thai places.  It is worth a try!  There is a wine store next door and a deli on 93rd for beer so even if you forget you don't have to go that far to get some libations.  I didn't ask if they had a restroom will investigate next time."", 'I ordered takeout on a late Sunday night. They sent me tofu instead of chicken. Ordinarily that would send me into a hissy fit but being that i was beyond starving I continued eating. I ordered the Thai red curry BBQ which was good a little spicy and the sticky rice had good texture. The small side salad was fresh and crisp. Fiance got the Korean bbq chicken which was decent too. Will order again for sure probably something different though.']","[""I've never been to Buddha BBeeQ but we've ordered delivery from here over a dozen times and it's our go-to good-eats any night of the week. The shrimp egg rolls the potato-wasabi dumplings the BBQ Beef the scallion pancakes...this place rocks! It's reasonably-priced the staff is professional and the food arrives quickly. If the delivery and the quality of the food we've received in that comely paper bag is any indication this place is a keeper -- and I am now realizing that I shouldn't be sharing this info with anyone lest Buddha BBeeQ gets too popular and things will change.  Short Version: this place is all kinds of awesome :-)"", ""If you're looking for real Korean food just stop reading right now.  The menu here reads like a pan-asian pop-chart gone karaoke.  That is every dish is sort of hollowed out of its soul and made to be appealing to an Upper East Side palate.   That being said I don't dislike their quirky amalgam of Vietnamese Thai Korean and Japanese influenced dishes--they all end up being something unique to the restaurant and very tasty.  Try the asian potato wasabi dumplings and become an instant sycophant.   Though I was a bit disappointed at their K-Rice bowl (which wasn't very K mind you).  Their food is fresh and good and not incredibly unhealthy.  The staff will bend over backwards to try to suit your needs even if you make requests that are off the menu.    Despite their good eats affordable lunch menu and excellent ambiance the restaurant is never packed probably due to its location smack-dab in the middle of 2nd ave road construction craziness.   Still  it's worth braving the incessant drone of jackhammers to dine at this quaint and quirky little spot."", ""Oh my goodness the Chile Peanut Noodles are amazing.  I added chicken which was thinly sliced and plentiful enough to balance the dish out.  If you are a peanut fan you'll be all over these noodles.  This will probably become a staple meal in my delivery food diet.  We've had the K Noodles with beef too which was all right but probably wouldn't get again because I guess we're not glass noodle people.  Potato wasabi dumplings were different then I expected.  I ordered them based on a previous posters positive review.  But perhaps if I would have read the menu closer and knew it was 2 large hankerchief sized pockets of filling fried with mango sauce I would not been so surprised when I opened the carry out container.  Though they only drizzled the mango sauce on one of the hankerchiefs so it would have been nice to have more of that.  And I thought there would be a lot more wasabi going on but I couldn't taste that flavor at all.    Veggie egg rolls were a little on the bland side so maybe get with a meat filling?  Also they didn't serve with a dip just a packet of soy sauce so I pulled out my own bottle of goodness from the fridge.  I'd probably get them again anyway but I have an addiction to fried things.""]","[""My gf and I were going through menupages and this place caught my eye so we took a short walk to grab a bite to eat.   We walk into the joint and apparently this location primarily caters to take out/delivery since there are only about 6-7 tables and they don't have a bathroom (...). Even before getting the menu and despite these issues as I always say let the food be the judge and sure enough it made the trip well worth it.  I'm not a connoisseur of Korean BBQ or cuisine for that matter but a lot of the dishes on the menu sounded delicious. My gf and I just stuck with the BBQ plates; I had mine with brown rice and the short ribs she had hers with the tofu if I'm not mistaken. I thought my plate was right on the money. The ribs they give you are fairly skinny and short but they are marinated perfectly and tasted like heaven. They serve the ribs with the above mentioned brown rice ($1.00 extra) and salad with some good house dressing they use. I was very pleased with the meal wasn't too much or two little and the price wasn't bad either. We also got the kimchee which was SUPER hot but good.   My recommendation: if the decor of a place influences you a lot in choosing and having your meal get some grub for delivery. But if you don't give a crap about the decor and seating of the place definitely head in for a bite to eat."", 'Always fresh and tasty -- this little place packs a big punch in an otherwise largely bereft of healthy  and high quality dining neighborhood.

Overall it was a nice dinner but probably won\'t be back again.', 'We selected Olives for our first dinner during a four night stay in New York. The selection was made primarily for the convenience of it being in our hotel the W Union Square. The crowd and the attitude of Olives is early-30s hipster (age not decade). It was 9:30 on a Thursday night and the place was quite full.  It\'s an attractive warm space but the very loud crowd made waiting near the hostess podium a less than welcoming experience. It was hard to hear my bride of 15 years amongst the din. I had the vaguely memorable uneasy feeling that I was on an awkward first date. Fortunately the quality of the food and the service served as an ice-breaker that saved the date. By ""quality"" I mean an disinterested assault on the senses.  The place is called Olives but as my wife pointed out it would be more aptly named SALT. The flavor of nearly everything we ate was overwhelmed by salt. The prosciutto and fig flatbread billed as an appetizer could easily be a meal in itself- a very salty meal. You should only order this if at least two other diners are sharing it and only if you enjoy the occasional salt lick.   My wife ordered the heirloom tomatoes and feta which would have been the highlight of the meal if again it wasn\'t for a deluge of salt.  Our entrees were surprise more salty than they should have been. My swordfish was garnished with sardines. What does this salty fish need? I know! Smaller saltier fish. The swordfish was OK not great. My other half is a vegetarian which is one reason she avoids salty prosciutto. For her entree she selected one of two possibilities the ravioli with butternut squash a hackneyed vegetarian option that is about as original as white tablecloths. The nice thing about most butternut squash raviolis is the sweet-savory coupling. Here the savory beat the crap out of the sweet.  The Maine wild blueberries with bananas foster ice cream and toasted brioche was by far the best thing I ate at Olives. The wife had some sort of tasty chocolate mousse pudding with (ugh) foam that was garnished with... drumroll... salt.  As far as the service goes I can\'t say I wasn\'t warned. Many of the Yelp reviews made clear that you shouldn\'t go to Olives expecting to find servers who care in the least about your dining experience. I don\'t believe our disinterested waiter ever once made eye contact with me or my wife. He rushed our order because ""it\'s restaurant week""- we weren\'t allowed to place an appetizer order without ordering our entrees at the same time. He was further inconvenienced by the fact that I was ordering based on the Olives menu I\'d seen online an hour earlier. That menu was not current and the scallops I\'d wanted weren\'t an option. You\'d think I\'d ordered pizza at a sushi bar the way he handled the situation. I was made to feel I\'d done something wrong and that I was making his life difficult. We were herded through our meal as if the only way this waiter could tolerate his job was to try and make it end sooner.  There are million dining options in the naked city- try one other than this.', ""No matter how many times I say I'll never be back I always seem to wind up at Olives for one reason or another. This time it was for a family Thanksgiving get together. I had been to Olives for a Thanksgiving a ways back and they had awesome seating upstairs in the banquet room. Unfortunately they closed that off this year due to a small turnout and the seating was in the regular restaurant.  As always their fig and prosciutto flat bread was spot on. They nail this every single time I've been here and it's one of the more delicious things on the menu. Also their bread selection was amazing. Fresh blazing hot and delicious. Aside from the bready stuff I got a Bibb lettuce salad which turned out to be bland and uninteresting. Actually after a few bites I gave up not wanting to waste precious calories on such a clunker. Then being that it was Thanksgiving I went with the traditional turkey and stuffing. It was actually quite good flavor wise and came with a sweet potato mash cranberry sauce and roasted brussel sprouts.  I had just one complaint about the meal which was that it was served luke warm rather than hot. I guess they had some temperature issues as they tried to time all the mains to come out at the same time. I passed on dessert and got a coffee that was actually not half bad.  For what it's worth I will note that most of the people at the table did seem to enjoy their food. The service was great and responsive though the intimate ambiance was a bit much with the extremely low lighting. Price wise it was about $55 a head not incl. tip. Yep expensive.

A friend and I went for dinner on a Friday night. First the food was mediocre at best - in general very large over-salted portions.Second the service was terrible - took 1.5 hours to get our entrees and I thought our waiter was more unfriendly than normal. Third the restaurant feels like a hotel restaurant - i.e. the crowd was skewed toward elderly people and tourists in shorts and t-shirts (at around 9pm).    Started with the fig and prosciutto flat bread. The portion was very large (the size of a small pizza) which I felt was unappetizing and I found that the salt content was so overwhelming that I was picking the prosciutto off the bread to lessen the impact (this is notable for me since I LOVE prosciutto).   Also had the tuna tartare - the only reason this restaurant deserves one star. The dish was light and flavorful. If you have the misfortune of dining at this establishment go for the tuna - it is likely their saving grace. Keep in mind that you should set aside the crackers or some of the bread (provided in the complimentary bucket of bread as soon as you are seated) as the tuna is served sans acoutrements.   Went with the Eggplant Ravioli for the main dish - this entrée was very salty to the point where I just couldn't eat it. Was surprised that the tomato ragu seemed to taste like lamb and the ravioli were really akin to large flat noodle chunks instead of stuffed pasta squares.   Overall the experience was very much lacking - I honestly wonder if Todd English would enjoy the food served at his own establishment.  Given the prices this restaurant charges save your money and go someplace else (shake shack is just around the corner).""]","[""How do I get one of these in L.A.?  The food was simply incredible - everything from the appetizers to desserts and everything in between.  During our 3-night stay at the W we had the opportunity to have a breakfast lunch and dinner at Olives and while I usually don't like to eat at the same place in the same trip Olives definitely was worth breaking that rule.  - Beef Carpaccio Salad - Mezze - Spicy Chicken Sausage flatbread - Butternut Squash Tortelli - Pan Roasted Salmon  All perfection.  The wait staff is top notch and drinks are strong.  They had secluded booths for a romantic date but you will see a lot of suits and travelers because of the location.  Standard NYC prices. Go go go!"", 'Olives a Todd English restaurant serves up consistently excellent fare at a steep price tag and in kind of blah ""this is a chic NYC restaurant"" setting.  There\'s nothing inherently wrong with that as Olives is catering to a specific customer it\'s just not my cup of tea. The service is superb the environment is big open and airy (+++) and the drinks are made with great precision.    The food is really really really good---I\'ve had the Beef Carpaccio Salad The Butternute Squash Tortelli and various fish dishes.  I would not go here if I were paying but I\'ve always been taken on someone else\'s dime typically a work function. I can understand why corporations hold functions here as the private dining rooms are spacious and the menu while nicely pared down really does offer something for almost every type of eater.', ""I went here for happy hour with my girlfriends. If you like girly martinis then this is the place for you. Its amazing that a gem like this can be found in Union Square. The ambiance of the location is pretty hip but seating can be a problem.   We definitely had our rounds of martinis for the night and that was fabulous. For snacks we ordered Flat Bread with Prosciutto and Fig Calamari and Beef Tips. Overall the snacks weren't anything to remember. But the steak tips for delicious. I would definitely order that again.   Also be weary of the wait staff. They hate it when you move around the bar they assume you plan on skipping the bill even though a card has already been left to keep the tab open.""]","['I was curious to try Olives after seeings some mixed reviews. And after my first experience there I feel I can understand both extremes.   To me the most important aspect of a meal especially at an upscale restaurant is the food. At Olives the food was all delicious and presented very nicely. The second most important aspect is service and Olives had both ups and downs in this area.   My small group shared the lobster bruschetta off of the specials menu to start. It was an interesting take on a classic Italian dish and I enjoyed it. There could have been a bit more lobster meat on top of the bread though.   For my main course I opted to try the pan fried rabbit Parmesan which was a bit of a departure for me. I\'m glad I took the chance though as the meat was tender the crusted coating was crispy and the sides -- especially the ricotta gnocchi -- were excellent. One of my friends had the cod which she enjoyed very much and my other friend had the black angus sirloin which he described as ""just ok."" For dessert we shared the oven roasted banana with salted caramel ice cream which was fantastic. The warm banana combined with the ice cream was an amazing combination and left me with a good impression of Olives.   When the bill arrived we discovered that the dessert had come on the house. When we inquired our server said that she knew we had waited a long time for our entrees so she took the dessert off the bill. We didn\'t even complain! So the low marks I was going to leave for service were canceled out by this pleasant surprise.   Give Olives a chance and try to be patient if the service isn\'t spectacular. The food makes it worth it and you might even get a free hot banana out of the deal...', ""Olives were everywhere at Olives and I definitely ate a lot of them (and olive oil).  I led off with the crispy artichoke salad (fried artichokes sure are a lovely component).  Next came a Mediterranean bronzino entree.  My dad's duck dish was a little on the small side but he enjoyed it.  And I finished the meal with the roasted banana dessert--something I wouldn't normally order but I'm glad that I did.  It had a lot going on--roasted banana ice cream with a little salt etc. etc.  Playful and tasty.  I didn't scope out the bar scene but it seemed to be bustling in that young corporate way.

There is a great bar scene connected directly to the W hotel. The chic space is filled with people lounging sipping conversing and sharing appetizers under smooth club beats played overhead. Step beyond the bar into the dining area complete with a view of the kitchen and Mr. English himself (sometimes).  The wine list is extensive in a bound book about 10 pages long. Most of the choices are common and broken down by the type of wine. Don't knock yourself out you can usually get something decent at the top of the list; rarely any sense in paying up for the pricier varieties at the bottom.  The food is good. I had a steak and it was tasty but reinforced why I rarely order steak at non-steakhouses. It wasn't tough because the inside cut fine but the combination of a seared outside and average consistency inside gave my hands a workout dicing the meat up. The flavor was great but I downplay the selection because it didn't cut like butter. The chicken was fantastic juicy and flavorful; served with potatoes and crispy green beans in a delicious base.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the service was very friendly and knowledgeable. I recognized parallels between Todd English and Danny Meyer in the sense that service is the utmost priority. Olive's is a great place and didn't seem to be overly touristy even being situated in an upscale hotel chain; a great spot to check out if in the Gramercy Flatiron or Union Square districts."", 'The service here is absolutely UNACCEPTABLY bad.

The breads and the tapenade was perfect and offered an assortment of olives and spreads. The tuna tartare was very good and had some surprise crispy shrimp at the bottom. It was a great cut of tuna and the entire dish was one of the best tartare I have had. I'm a sucker for a good salad and the arugula one was very well made and quit a bit of food.

I've had 3 decent meals here in the past... I don't know if they're really just not trying for Restaurant Week or if things really *have* gone downhill at Olives.  But I *do* know that I'm never coming back again especially with all the other superior restaurants around.  Each of us had only 1 passable dish out of 3 and that earns a failing mark in my book.  Here's what we ate.  Appetizers:  Creamy Corn Flatbread - Not as exciting as it seems by far.  It was basically flatbread with ricotta and sweetcorn kernels scattered about artlessly.  Heirloom Squash Carpaccio - This was the only decent dish I had of the meal.  Though I feel as if none of the ingredients were as special as advertised.  Entrées:  Pan Roasted Rainbow Trout - My husband ordered this entree and it was his only decent course.  The trout was cooked well.  The rest of it wasn't anything to write home about.  Creamed Beet Green Ravioli - I only received 3 pieces of mediocre ravioli... and they have the nerve to call this an entrée?  I couldn't even taste the truffle that they advertised.  Dessert:  Wild Maine Blueberries with panna cotta corn bread and Kix. - We both ordered this one and boy were we disappointed.  We both agreed that the overall composition was schizophrenic the ingredients didn't have any dialogue with each other and that it was really just trying too hard to be Momofuku's Cereal Milk panna cotta (FAR superior).  Also the blueberries were covered in a gummy sauce and tasted like canned pie filling.  Utterly flavorless.  The dessert was so horrendous that we actually had to go to Momofuku Milk Bar afterward to get the taste of it out of our mouths.  Yes it was THAT bad that we chose to spend an extra $11 on dessert elsewhere.  As for the service -- our waitress was inattentive and we ended up having to have our orders taken *and* had to ask for our check from other waiters.  When I want to have a meal at an expensive restaurant I expect to be blown away.  I was extremely underwhelmed and feel ripped off."", ""What could be better than catching up with a great friend over a wonderful meal during restaurant week? (aka: at an incredible value. $35 for appetizer entree and dessert) We began our evening with cocktails. Mine was a refreshing Olives' signature drink with vodka pineapple and ginger over ice with a sugar rim. I'm really not a drinker this was my first drink in about 6 weeks but it totally hit the spot on this 95 degree day. The bread basket tapenade and olives were an excellent snack alongside of our drinks. Specifically the caramelized onion focaccia was especially tasty. We shared both appetizer offerings. One was a light summery squash carpaccio with Parmesan and a little tempura'd squash blossom stuffed with cheese. MMmmmMMMmm. This was my favorite dish of the night. It tasted just like summer should. The other was a sweet corn and ricotta flatbread with leeks. Savory sweet and salty with a great crunchy crust. I'm being especially picky by mentioning that I would have liked more corn and leek piled on top it was mostly bread and cheese. It was still perfectly delicious the way it was though.  My duck entree was slightly more cooked than medium but If I remember right I think I just told the waiter to have the chef prepare it as he/she saw fit. Though I didn't love the lentils which were a bit salty I thought the figs and the duck married beautifully and were a luxurious tasting duo.   Desserts are something I always save room for. It is by far my favorite course of any meal. Tonight they were a total disappointment. We shared both of the restaurant week choices and were surprised to see how similar they were. Both were a gelatinous pudding-like substance with a sauce and some cereal thrown on top. The chocolate one simply because it was chocolate was the better one. It came with a lovely strawberry ice on the side atop a chocolate fudgy thing. That part was great. The rest? Not so much. The other one tasted like cheesecake flavored jello. On top was a handful of kix. Cute but really? The blueberry sauce was the best part and I kind of wished I had something else to put it on. All in all despite the dessert bummer Olives was a top of the line choice. Beautiful setting super convenient location charming service (thanks Nathan!) and hip creative ingredients and pairings. I will definitely put this one on my plan-to-return list.""]","['flatbread', 'flatbread', 'flatbread']","['cheese', 'cream', 'cream']","['way', 'egg', 'egg']","['half', 'half', 'half']","['lamb', 'lamb', 'lamb']","['beef', 'beef', 'beef']","['banana', 'banana', 'banana']","['cut', 'cut', 'cut']","['crepe', 'lemon']","['cereal', 'cereal']"

So I go from time to time and always stick to the same menu clams or soup and a burger. It is always satisfying and relax. The owner/manager is a very sweet person that still recognizes me for those mad Basketball days. and they deliver across the street when I am in an antisocial mood. Not much for the ambiance so I wont give it a five stars but I am so grateful they are so close to home.'],"[""Went here to pick up lunch today.  Cute place good place to sit and eat.  Its got a nice calm and quiet bar with a few people who had come in solo.  Seems a bit neighborhood'y the guy sitting right by us as we ordered chatted us up and talked about how his wife microwaved a whole garlic pod and how the skin magically came away and was the most delicious thing on turkey!!!  Digressing here   I ordered the Balboa sandwich - beef with melted cheese and garlic bread.  Thing is when they say garlic bread its really garlic bread!!! I dont know how they do it but u have pieces of like fried garlic powdered or something on the inside of the roll. Delish.   The sandwich came with fries I didnt order them so unfortunately they had to be eaten. Its destiny!     Portions are huge Oh and you get three pieces of pickle the round ones.  Booo-ring I wish they gave the long ones.   Still totally worth it.   Price: $9 or so I think.   I'd go there again for sure.   Ive heard the blackened shrimp is decent too.""]","[""Went here to pick up lunch today.  Cute place good place to sit and eat.
