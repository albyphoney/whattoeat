This was one of my favorite reasons for being able to call LA my home for 8 years.  I have since moved back to nor cal but I still have wet dreams about this place.  I am not sure what everyone else gets but I get the garlic chicken.  What isn't there to like?  They give you a huge chicken soaked in this butter garlic situation with onions buttery rice plantains and black beans.  I can't recall the price off of the top of my head but it is a steal.  I always include the avocado salad because this is the real kicker to the dish.  My hubby always prepares the avo salad with the oil vinegar salt and pepper and you eat it with the chicken... AMAZING!!  We just visited the in-laws and dropped by Versailles... it's been about a year or so but it still hit the spot.  I can't stress how much the avo salad really brings this entire dish together but do yourself a favor and order it.""]","['Sangria Plantains and best of all Bob Saget.  I\'ve been coming here for several years now and I have always loved this place. The menu has stayed the same but visually has changed drastically! It started off as a dingy paper menu years ago but now it\'s fancy complete with pictures!  Let me just say first of all that the parking situation here particularly on a Thursday Friday or Saturday night is terrible. Thankfully I live a short walking distance away so I take a stroll out there every now and then to enjoy a glass (or pitcher!) of sangria. Thankfully I am a stone\'s throw away from this Versailles location.  More on the sangria. It just has the right taste. Just enough sweetness plenty of tang with a few slices of orange. I can plow through this like fruit punch hell almost like water. It\'s dangerous. Being a brand new graduate student at UCLA a few years ago there was nothing better than driving over (yep dangerous) to Versailles (when I didn\'t live anywhere near it) and having a pitcher of sangria for $14.99 after a hard day. Unfortunately those days are over. I can\'t handle a pitcher of sangria anymore merely a glass or two. But to my benefit I don\'t spend as much money. The sangrias prices have upped to $19.99 per pitcher and remained at about $3.99 per glass.  Also... their bread! Devastatingly simple. They cut off pieces of freshly (daily) baked bread toast it and spread some butter sauce on top. Just enough to get it a little soaked but make the paper they deliver it on absolutely clear. Yes some cardiac arrest is in the works but oh so worth it at Versailles. Sometimes I must ask for a second order.  I usually stick with the whole chicken the roast pork or the fried pork chunks (sorry I can\'t remember the numbers) and I am always happy. ALWAYS. You may think that is ""oil"" at the bottom of your roast pork or chicken pile but no that is their special marinade dubbed ""Mojo sauce"". It is a very tangy lemon-y mixture that they grill fry and cook everything with at their establishment.  Even more fantastic is that they include with nearly every dish a solid helping of moro (black beans within!) rice and my personal favorite plantains! You may not expect it but mix the beans and rice together and with the excess dip your plantains. Heck dip your plantains in the excess moro sauce. Soaking up the tangy/salty juices along with the contrast of the sweet plantains? HEAVEN. Absolute perfection.  Another dish I also enjoy here (and had tonight!) is the Cuban Sandwich. A nice helping of pickles swiss cheese and mustard on a 9-10 inch roll along with a generous slice of ham and roasted pork leg to top it off. Throw on some tapatillo sauce and some ketchup for your fries and you\'ve got yourself a perfect meal that you can take on the go in a pinch! I\'ve done that meal for lunch many times switching off to the Bistec (steak) sandwich as well as the roast pork sandwich. Fortunately they recently updated the menu to allow you to get the sandwich/fries meal for dinner. For many years this was not possible and they told you so.  And what do you know?! A celebrity sighting! Bob Saget and his girlfriend were sitting at the table behind us. They had the whole chicken and the roasted pork. I like his choices (AND his style)!

We got seated and figured out quickly what we wanted to order. I raised my hand like a good 4th grade student but everyone ignored me.  My friend tried to flag down a server and even after making eye contact with 2 no one came to help us. Eventually a server who was helping the table next to us stopped by to take our order.  I got the Tamales appetizer (2 pork tamales) and my friend ordered Bistec de Pollo.  My tamales were ok but there was very little pork.  In fact I would say that pork made up about 5% of each tamal.  The sauce it was in was not bad but the abundance of completely raw onions on top of the dish was not appetizing.  My friend's chicken was hard cold and not good at all.  He said that he could make better chicken at home and he's no gourmet chef.  It was also topped with enough onions to make an army cry but at least his onions were slightly cooked.  The plantains that came with the dish were pretty good but how can anyone mess up frying plantains right? The side of rice that came with the dish was stale and clumpy.  Yuck!

Service was top-notch and the portions are enormous making the $$ notation really a $ unless you eat enough for 4. The bread before the meal was amazing and I couldn't stop munching on it.  I ordered the lechón asado which was very well seasoned but a bit dry for my taste. (I would have ordered their famous chicken if I weren't afraid that it would have been wayyyy too dry as chicken usually is.) The plantains were delicious and the rice and beans... were rice and beans. I wasn't a big fan of the raw onions on top but they were really good the next day!  Since I only ate a third of my plate and a friend gave me a third of hers I had enough lechón and onions to experiment with the next day. For lunch I browned the onions and reheated the pork in it for a bit making the onions much more palatable and the pork a tiny bit less dry. For dinner I put the remaining pork on a sandwich--also yummy.  Next time I'll order the ropa vieja. If they could manage to make ropa vieja dry... they wouldn't have gotten such good ratings.

You never know if it could just be an off-night during the summer or if you're about to sign yourself for some late-night bathroom fun.   While this definitely doesn't make the winner's circle for my favorite DC Thai restaurants it certainly wasn't bad. We both started off with shrimp tom yum soup that was flavorful and authentic. My fiance had the drunken noodles and I had tofu with peanut curry both of which were palatable and large portions if not the best I've ever eaten. I ended the meal with some mango and sticky rice that was the perfect consistency and taste--it's one of my favorite sweet treats.   The restaurant itself is clean but nothing to write home about in the decor department. It looks slightly dated. The service was polite and efficient.   It did seem that they got a lot of orders for pick-up while we were in there and given that it's at 14th and K I imagine it's more of a lunch crowd. But it'd be hard to believe it will be around much longer if what we experienced on Friday was the typical dinner rush."", ""I keep telling myself I'm not coming back here but it never fails I come back.  Last time I was there the manager made a stink because I had a gift certificate he thought was expired (it wasn't... it was valid for a year but that didn't stop him from call the 1-800 number of the place I purchased the certificate from to check).  The time before that the waiter forgot about us entirely. And the time before that the waitress did the same (on top of not saying one word to us).  Still for some reason or another at least once every 6 weeks or so I find myself back in the small restaurant staring mindlessly at the thai art replicas and pasty lilac walls.  It's convenient (around the corner from work) and the food is decent but the real reason I keep coming back is Bangkok One set my world on fire... well really just my drink.   The Flaming Volcano as its called is the biggest drink in town but has the smallest price (like $6 or something) and comes with a fiery lemon set afloat on a wave happy hour goodness.  The best thing about the Flaming Volcano is that unlike the implied effects of its name the drink actually goes down quite smoothly and is down right refreshing.  It was the perfect pairing for my seafood fried rice which was so spicy it cleared up my sinuses.  Also the Flaming Volcano doesn't hit you while you are drinking it... it kicks in about 30 minutes after which I loooooved!  Made for a good base buzz as I continued with my festivities for the night.  LOL!  Recommendations for a Bangkok One Visit: 1) Getting a Flaming Volcano 2) Go at lunch time for food (same portions and quality as the dinner menu but significantly cheaper) but  3) don't come at noon.  It's packed. Come after - more like 1:30ish.  That's perfect. 4) If you are on the job and don't want to drink in the afternoon come after work for drinks.  They are all uber cheap.  It's like having happy hour specials around the clock and without promotion. 5) Food-wise any of the fried rice dishes or Drunken Noodles are great.  I got the Goong Bikini for an appetizer (mostly because I liked saying the name so much) and it was pretty good... odd but good.  Sticky rice is ok for dessert but not a must have.""]","['Came here for lunch with two friends after a meeting in the area.   One of the worst places I\'ve been too in a while.

(Note: Trader Joe\'s/ ""Trader Ming\'s"" pad thai from a box isn\'t that bad but food from a restaurant shouldn\'t taste like it was just microwaved. )   The only reason this place didn\'t get one star is because my other friends soft shell crab was well cooked it was overly sweet  but still tasted pretty good.

Started with the summer rolls (vegetables and shrimp in a rice paper) which had a good flavor were fresh and came with a peanut sauce. I would strongly recommend these. Also ordered the goong bikini appetizer (whole shrimp in friend  an egg roll type wrapper) with a sweet and sour sauce. These weren't bad but I would stick with the summer rolls instead.  I had the thai iced tea to drink. Give this a try...it's basically sweet tea with half and half or creme mixed in. It's really filling but give it a shot with your meal.   I had the massuman curry (beef with potatoes onions and carrots in a curry sauce). The beef was well done and not fatty the curry sauce had some sweetness and some spice with it. It almost reminded me a little bit of a beef stew but spicier and came with rice.  Depending on what you get it can be a little pricey for an everyday lunch but it's a definite place to go for an office lunch or to stop by once or twice a week. If you get it to go and skip the appetizer or drinks it's around $10.00 before tip tax etc.  Skip the mediocre places downtown and give this place a try instead.""]","[""Went  here on a Monday night during my business trip with a coworker.  The place was pretty empty (it was around 9 on Monday night) but the waitress came right out to us.  She made some rec's for us as my friend is Vegan pretty much.  Prices are very low to mid range and portions were really good for $15.  We had the tofu pad thai w/o egg (i kno it needs egg but is ok w/o XD) tofu red curry (friend asked for it to be extra spicy and it was XD) vegetable dumplings and Volcano seafood entree.  Waitress brought our drinks and then a young man started taking care of us seems like he had limited English proficiency but he really tried to answer my friends questions so points for that.  After ordering all this food we asked about how long it would be and he said 5 minutes it was more around 20 minutes.  After the little wait the food came out piping hot and was decent for the price range.  I would consider it pretty average Thai food but I was looking for something better than a quick fast food chain.  I left satisfied with some pad thai for the next day.  Took off a star because the waitress had an attitude when she had to explain DC's plastic bag thing to us and he it would cost me extra money.  Maybe she was having a bad day but in DC I'm sure she serves plenty of people who don't know about the bag policy.  Took another star off because the restaurant was warmer than outside and my friends dinner had tofu in it when she requested no tofu.  I'd go there again if I had to but I wouldn't make any special trips."", 'Came here for lunch with two friends after a meeting in the area.   One of the worst places I\'ve been too in a while.   We all ordered Thai Iced Teas and an order of fried vegetable dumplings to start. The Thai Iced Teas were flavorful but tastedl like at least half a cup of sugar had been put in each one I finished about half of mine and felt a bit nauseous. As for the the dumplings they weren\'t horrendous but were clearly from a frozen bag 5 dollars for 8 dumplings? I could have bought a bag of 32 for 4 dollars at an asian market.   For our main dishes. I got the salmon in red curry sauce lunch special. My friends got the soft shell crab and the pad thai.   My salmon came out and the inside was STILL FROZEN.  They apologized profusely and brought me out another one. I know this place isn\'t super clasy but it really turned me off to know that my food was not fresh at all and simply heated after being taken out of a freezer and served to me. My friend\'s pad thai was sub par and tasted like it came out of a Trader Joe\'s pad thai box. (Note: Trader Joe\'s/ ""Trader Ming\'s"" pad thai from a box isn\'t that bad but food from a restaurant shouldn\'t taste like it was just microwaved. )   The only reason this place didn\'t get one star is because my other friends soft shell crab was well cooked it was overly sweet  but still tasted pretty good.   I hear they have good happy hour specials though so I might be back. I do not recommend this place though.', ""The BKK dumplings kicked ass and were an amazing starter.  The rest of the food was pretty mediocre though. We had fried tilapi fillet in a generic brown flavorless sauce and some bland drunken noodles. The dishes were good enough and fresh but didn't make any impression on my palate.  I will probably be back because the location is convenient and it isn't expensive. Also since we were the only couple in the restaurant at 7pm on a tuesday service was super.""]","[""I had dinner there the first weekend I moved to DC. I can't remember what I had or what my friend had. But I don't remember that we were for or against it. I don't even remember what I had. So not memorable.  I craved thai yesterday for lunch after my friend from Philly reminded me of our fave spot there. I went back b/c its th eonly thai place in walking distance (in the cold) near my office on 15th and H. I got take out.   Orderted the Tom Yum soup. It was fine but more coconutty than lemon-grassy which was weird. I love Thai and always order the Tom Yum so I could tell the odd difference right away.   Druken noodles. Also a favorite of mine. It was soupy. Yeah not like chili pasty. But all the soupy-ness was at the bottom of the dish. The flat noodles were still white. I am used to it being seasoned. The chicken tasted odd. I didn't finish most of my dish. I always finish my thai.   Maybe b/c it was take out and I didn't sit in that accounted for odd taste. But usually take out food isn't horrible.   I can't say positive or negative for the service. Order was ready on time as they said on the phone in 15 minutes. Thats about it.   I had to compensate for my awful thai lunch by going for thai dinner. And luckily my roomate new of a fabulous spot within walking distance to wear we live in Truxton Circle. 4th and NJ Ave I think. AWESOME drunken noodles and pad thai. Fresh salad. and great service. Will try their soup nexttime. I think it was Beau Thai but I can't remember the name.   p.s. DC Noodle House has great Pad Thai and Drunken noodles.  Wish they opened one near my job. Philly if you are ever there has multiple awesome thai places."", ""OK I made the mistake of going in at 12:30 during the lunch rush. After 10 minutes I noticed that the people who came in at the same time as me AND the people who came in after me had already ordered and gotten their drinks. After 15 minutes as I was getting up to leave the waiter came over and took my order. 25 minutes later my soup arrived. The table of 6 that sat next to me after I had been there for 20 minutes was already eating their entrees!. It really wasn't that busy as there were several empty tables. I may go there again even though it was awful because the food is ok and it is right by the office. I hate having to settle for mediocre just because it's close by."", ""We hit up Bangkok One this weekend because we'd seen it walking by a few times and decided to check it out. This was a bold move at the time because we were literally the only people in the restaurant on Friday night at 7. You never know if it could just be an off-night during the summer or if you're about to sign yourself for some late-night bathroom fun.   While this definitely doesn't make the winner's circle for my favorite DC Thai restaurants it certainly wasn't bad. We both started off with shrimp tom yum soup that was flavorful and authentic. My fiance had the drunken noodles and I had tofu with peanut curry both of which were palatable and large portions if not the best I've ever eaten. I ended the meal with some mango and sticky rice that was the perfect consistency and taste--it's one of my favorite sweet treats.   The restaurant itself is clean but nothing to write home about in the decor department. It looks slightly dated. The service was polite and efficient.   It did seem that they got a lot of orders for pick-up while we were in there and given that it's at 14th and K I imagine it's more of a lunch crowd.

Tucked in amidst a number of high-end swanky restaurants (replete with of course sofas outside) is Bangkok One. Of my time in DC perhaps the strangest restaurant experience I\'ve had.  First of all the smell of the restaurant is very strange. It smells like a mixture of pineapple and sewage. Did not smell good at all.  Second the service was prompt though this could be explained by the fact that my girlfriend and I were the only people in the restaurant at 6:30 on a Friday.   Third the appetizer the Vegetable rolls tasted like they could have come out of a freezer at your local Giant. The Thai iced coffee tasted about what one would expect of Thai Iced Coffee while my gf got the Thai Iced Tea (way too sweet).  Dinner and dessert: the worst pad thai I had ever eaten...ever. Noodles seemed like a mixture of undercooked and overcooked (if possible). Though the taste was ok (more peanuty than pad thais I\'ve had before) it still was very sub-par. Dessert though was bar none the WORST dessert I have had in DC. Another review had classified the ice cream as ""old and stale""- we got a red bean ice cream and that encapsulated the ice cream perfectly.  The only reason I give this two stars: it has a coupon on  http://restaurant.com  so our meal cost significantly less than it would have. Good if you want a cheap meal but otherwise not worth it.', '$3 beers( chang) all day and yummy food! For dessert try the coconut ice cream....', 'We ate here while visiting DC one night when we realized we weren\'t ""dressed"" to eat at the other places in the neighborhood. Although it was mostly empty that night it had plenty of seating; I assume it gets busy during lunch hour. We had the specials with perfectly cooked shrimp and those clear glassy noodles yummy. Pad Thai was great as well but the best part was the Thai Iced Tea. Very aromatic and tasty. Few other couples came in as we were eating but the waiter was still very attentive and nice. Decor is kind of cool they have artifacts in little glass cases that are very pretty and nice conversation starters. Food is good people were nice and price was right!']","[""My friend said 'Meet me at Bangkok One'. It rang a bell because this restaurant was wedged between Tattoo and Lima - I remembered walking past it before. The restaurant was completely dead - I kept telling my friend perhaps it's still early in the evening until I tried the food. We had a waiter who didnt understand a word we said and he stood there for minutes we felt really awkward. I wanted the Thai iced tea but I asked for that it was not too sweet and he couldnt understand that. After looking at this puzzled face I asked for a coke instead.  For appetizer I ordered the mango salad - it came out chunks of mangos with some onions and peppers I was dumbfounded. I expected the mango salad as unripened shredded mango like a papaya salad boy was I wrong about that. For the entree I ordered the Siam noodles with special spicy sauce it was just seafood with the wide rice noodles and not the least bit spicy. I was disppointed with the dinner. The food tasted fine but it didnt wow me. Poorly executed Thai food.  With the same waiter we asked for him to break change for a $20 again he stood there for 5 minutes struggling to figure out what we were asking for. In the end an older gentleman walked up to us and took care of it."", ""We hit up Bangkok One this weekend because we'd seen it walking by a few times and decided to check it out.

The restaurant was very quiet compared to its neighbor DC Coast. We walked in the restaurant thinking maybe we won't get to eat there because they might be closed soon. To our delight the very polite and timid Thai fella told us they are open till at least 11 if not midnight. Upon learning that we flopped our butts down as he led us to our booth passing one other couple.  Since it was so late we didn't want to pig out like we usually would after a long day at work so we decided to go with one appetizer and one entree to share. We ordered the Yum Mango (special of the month) as an appetizer which was mango onions tomatoes green beans in a spicy cilantro lime dressing and drunken noodles an an entree. Of course we asked for the dishes to be prepared Thai spicy. The Yum Mango came out really fast and it was DELICIOUS!!! The sweetness of the mango and the sourness of the lime dressing fired up with Thai chili flakes it was such a nice kick for your tastebuds. The drunken noodles came out 2 minutes after we finished our appetizer and it was the best drunken noodles I've had yet in the DC area. Usually when you get drunken noodles the noodles come out swimming in a plate of oil and everything looks dark and greasy which is precisely the reason I almost never order drunken noodles unless the craving for spicy grease creeps up on me. But the drunken noodles at Bangkok One was so different and wonderfully tasty. When the dish came out I couldn't see the noodles. As I found out as I dug my chopsticks in the noodles were covered by a yummy thick layer of stir-fried chicken (or beef or pork depends on what you order) and the noodles seemed and tasted like they were just boiled real quick instead of stir-fried. So they boiled the noodles put them on the plate and then poured the chicken and the sauce over it. Since chicken doesn't absorb much grease and the noodles are boiled the dish was light yet tasty.   I was so content after my appetizer and entree that I didn't feel the need to order dessert for once. Now I know where I'll be going for a late dinner next time I'm stuck in the office again while everybody else is out enjoying happy hour.""]","[""I had dinner there the first weekend I moved to DC.

Came in today for lunch because it was close to work and once I got seated they brought out some dishes that had burnt spices and the whole half of the restaurant started coughing. People were requesting to have their food boxed so that they could leave. The smell in the restaurant was awful and the table in front of me was covering their nose with a napkin while eating.   I had vegetable tom yum which tasted nothing like tom yum soup I had at any other Thai restaurant. Basically it was spicy broth with some carrots which is not really tom yum. The Shrimp and Tofu Pad Thai had TWO shrimps and no tofu and no peanuts it was just noodles and tasted completely off. What a rip off!!!! I will never come back!!!!']","[""A great lunch spot in downtown DC.  Started with the summer rolls (vegetables and shrimp in a rice paper) which had a good flavor were fresh and came with a peanut sauce. I would strongly recommend these. Also ordered the goong bikini appetizer (whole shrimp in friend  an egg roll type wrapper) with a sweet and sour sauce. These weren't bad but I would stick with the summer rolls instead.  I had the thai iced tea to drink. Give this a try...it's basically sweet tea with half and half or creme mixed in. It's really filling but give it a shot with your meal.   I had the massuman curry (beef with potatoes onions and carrots in a curry sauce). The beef was well done and not fatty the curry sauce had some sweetness and some spice with it. It almost reminded me a little bit of a beef stew but spicier and came with rice.

The outdoor seating is a great idea makes everyone feel as if they are eating somewhere important but you arent. You are eating right next to the super fast and dirty and loud road which makes the gross meal even grosser.   I ordered the Vegetarian Pizza something I assumed would be simple to make (if Dominos can do it so can a few heavy set Italians)  The sun dried tomatoes were burnt to a CRISP it smelled like a pair of orthopedic shoes the old lady on my street wears when she glares at me from her stoop.  My boyfriend got the Seafood Pasta which was pretty much a few old mussels and 54 garlic cloves. Our server forgot our second round of drinks and just really had better things to do then be at Caffe Graffiti.  All and all...pass on this place.

I'd definitely head back here again provided I could sit in the more intimate back area away from the bar metal tables and bright lights.  The restaurant personality of Caffe Graffiti is quite nice encompassing about 10 tables in a darker back area presided over by a wall-sized arched brick window overlooking the street. The food is typical pasta chicken and seafood in mammoth portions for under $17.  The calamari appetizer is tasty crispy without a hint of sogginess. I could do without the vegetables mixed in though because if I wanted vegetable tempura I would have ordered that. It's kind of hard to tell sometimes if it's a cauliflower of small piece of calamari.  I had the Rigatoni Boscaiola which was perfectly cooked but a bit too saucy for my liking. Of course I foolishly finished the whole thing and slipped into a food coma unable to even get in a second glass of wine.  Despite a lack of room for more wine when in a Caffe that neglects to serve coffee instead opting only for espresso beverages one must see what's up. The espresso shot was sweet with only a touch of bitterness and sugar wasn't really necessary. I love that it's served in the traditional way without even a hint of an offer for cream.  It's strange because its seems that despite being on the visible front of the North End we had no problem finding a seat on a Friday night at 8.

The food is typical pasta chicken and seafood in mammoth portions for under $17.  The calamari appetizer is tasty crispy without a hint of sogginess. I could do without the vegetables mixed in though because if I wanted vegetable tempura I would have ordered that. It's kind of hard to tell sometimes if it's a cauliflower of small piece of calamari.  I had the Rigatoni Boscaiola which was perfectly cooked but a bit too saucy for my liking. Of course I foolishly finished the whole thing and slipped into a food coma unable to even get in a second glass of wine.  Despite a lack of room for more wine when in a Caffe that neglects to serve coffee instead opting only for espresso beverages one must see what's up. The espresso shot was sweet with only a touch of bitterness and sugar wasn't really necessary. I love that it's served in the traditional way without even a hint of an offer for cream.  It's strange because its seems that despite being on the visible front of the North End we had no problem finding a seat on a Friday night at 8. They take reservations but if you're shut out of other places in the area you'll most likely find perch here. Our server Frankie was super friendly to myself and my ladyfriend and was really enjoyable overall."", 'A couple of weeks ago GroupOn had a deal that was good for $40 worth of food for only $20 at Caffe Graffiti and I was excited to visit. So last Friday night my boyfriend and I ventured into the North End. I lucked out and parked outside which was definitely a high point.   We had eaten a late lunch that day so we planning to maybe split an app have dessert and maybe a drink or two. I told the hostess this but when the waiter realized he seemed a little miffed that we were not ordering dinner. He actually seemed grouchy the whole time. Mind you the place was empty so he should have been glad to be waiting on anyone.   For a beverage we each ordered the Pomegranate Fizz. It was pretty good but definitely low alcohol content. I think they waved the St. Germain over it. We decided to order the fried calamari to which our waiter proclaimed ""good choice no one else makes it like us."" Well he was right but not in a good way...we were served what appeared to be a large portion of fried calamari but upon closer examination you could see that they ""fill"" the order with fried vegetables (Cauliflower carrots peppers etc). I would not have minded the addition of the vegetables but for the fact they were drenched in lemon and salt making them unpleasant to eat.   Throughout our time there I mentioned to the waiter that we wanted dessert. However he never asked us if we wanted it and after ordering a second round of drinks (cordial of Sambuca and a SoCo Sour) he brought us the check. I had to remind him we wanted to dessert.   At that point we should have just left but the Baccio Gelato was calling my name so we had some. That was all that looked appealing to me in the case (they do not have a dessert menu).   Sad to say I will not be adding Caffe Graffiti to my elite list of favorite spots in the North End.', ""My boyfriend and I had a groupon for this place. We arrived around 8pm on a Friday night and got a table for dinner right away. He wanted to seat us in the middle of the room but I prefer sitting next to a wall (I don't know why just something comforting about sitting next to a wall) so I asked him if he could move and he was really nice about it and moved us right away (after cleaning the table next to the wall).  The service was really great the wait staff was friendly. We ordered fried calamari for appetizer and it was more than enough for the 2 of us. Yes they do add some filler vegetables but it wasn't that much.  My boyfriend go pork tenderloin and I got the veal parmesan and they were both decent-sized. I normally don't eat a lot so I had veal parm for lunch the next day. Both dishes were pretty good and tasty but we considered it average for North End. The pork tenderloin was really good but the potatoes were waaay salty. And my veal parm with penne pasta was probably something I could make at home so in my opinion not worth the $17 we paid for. But the groupon made it worth it!""]","['After reading the other reviews I think we can all agree that the service here is horrible. Our waiter was a very obnoxious little man indeed. The main reason we came here was because we looked at their lunch menu outside and not being very hungry wanted to order something quick and small. When he gave us the dinner menus I asked him if they had the lunch menu that was advertised outside and his only response was ""No"" before turning and walking away. If it wasn\'t so cold outside we probably would have got up and left but we stayed and ordered some very ordinary Caesar salad and undercooked Calamari. I doubt if we\'d ever waste our time and money here again.', 'SHORT VERSION: GLAD I had a 1/2 PRICE PRE-PAID CARD... This place was empty and the waiter was still impatient &amp; annoyed.  We wanted to eat outdoors but arrived to find their patio EMPTY.  The waiter tells us we should eat inside because it\'s getting cold out and other diners have moved inside.  SO...we let him lead us in...  ...to another EMPTY DINING ROOM!  Where are these ""other diners?""  Despite the lack of work for the waiter he still gave off an air of IRRITATION ATTITUDE &amp; ANNOYANCE.  I was served 6 or 8 RAVIOLI...FOR A DINNER PORTION.  I\'m a small girl and I left hungry.  SALAD WAS NOT INCLUDED.  The prices were NOT CHEAP.  The ravioli was NOT MEMORABLE.  The atmosphere was NON-EXISTENT.', 'So as promised I returned to Cafe Graffitti to try out the actual cafe section. It could not have been a better evening. We were lucky enough to be seated by an open window overlooking the city.  My boyfriend and I split the Caprice\'s pizza and chicken Cesar salad. Both were absolutely delicious. The chicken came out hot on the salad (I happen to hate cold chicken) and the dressing was thick and creamy. The pizza was also pretty tasty all the ingredients were fresh.  The service was decent but it is the ambiance that makes this place. It has a little bit of an ""high end"" feeling without losing the cafe vibe. Definitely a great place to grab a drink whether it is coffee or wine. Just make sure if you want dinner you specify you want to eat in the cafe!']","[""Meh... disappointing   Let me start with what was great about this place:  The view of the city while sitting outside. Yup that's it.  I should have known better and made a reservation somewhere else on a Saturday evening in the North End. This was the only place that we could find that had a table open... never a good sign.   Our waiter was more interested in smoking on the side of the building than remembering to bring our drinks or water. The food - blah. We started with the eggplant rollatini - rubbery and unimpressive. For dinner I had the shrimp scampi it had absolutely no flavor... and the shrimp was dry. Desert you ask? No thank you!   I will not be making a second appearance here."", 'Ambiance:  We decided to check this place after buying a ""Groupon"" type deal for half off. We ended up going for an early dinner at 5:30 as we were going to see a comedy show after. When we got there the windows were open and only a few tables were seated. The windows being open would have been great altough this was a chilly June evening. Lucky for my girlfriend they ended up closing them halfway through our meal so she wasn\'t shivering the whole time.  Food : I got the special a seafood risotto and my girlfriend got the chicken parm. The risotto was nice and creamy tons of seafood but for someone who loves seafood thought it had a little too much of a seafood mix and taste. The presentation was great but not eater friendly I had to remove the tails from the shrimp and remove the shells.   Service: Waiter was nice and quick. Food was out extremely fast and his recommendatons were good.  Overall: Food was good just a little expensive. They only had beer and wine. Not sure if I would go back.']","[""I had lunch at Cafe Graffiti with a few of my friends over Memorial Day weekend and I was impressed!

But I had the Fusilli di Casa which was phenomenal.  Most of the food on the menu is stuff I'd make at home but when I'm home I don't have the experience of people watching on a patio in the North End.

The atmosphere of this place was nice.    My experience with the service was not so good.  When we ordered there were no plates or settings and it took a while for bring them out while our appetizers were sitting on the table getting cold.  And it was just placed at the end of our table we had a group of 9.  The table wasn't that long but it was not handed out to us.  Alot of us ordered the Steak.  only one of them came with a steak knife.  We asked for knives so again food was just sitting there while we waited for a while for knives.    I had ordered mine with a side of fries.  But after my steak came out they than came to tell me that they had run out of fries would I like something else.  So I ordered fried plantaines instead.  I was pretty much done eating and no plantaines.    My friend had ordered a shake waited a while still no shake.  The waitress comes and tells her the manager is in the basement getting stuff ot make it or something to that extent.  10 minutes later still nothing.  Than finally came back and told us the machine was broken!  Still at this point no plantaines. We were all done eating and the check had came out.  I complained to my friend on the table about it and I guess the waitress heard me and came over and apologized and said sorry we already charged you though.    Uh - what was I suppose to say to that?  Still ended up paying for it even though we never got it.    So the experience that I had here was TERRIBLE.

Here's what I loved about the place:  - gorgeous warm friendly vibrant decor that transports you to somewhere tropical and makes you forget the sketchy neighborhood you just passed through to get here  - super-friendly waitress who patiently answered our millions of qs  - ridonkulously huge portions of so much food our spacious table for 6 literally could not hold any more plates before our sides had finished arriving  - amazing prices for the ridonkulously huge portions of food  Here's what didn't thrill me: The food itself really wasn't that amazing.  Our group got the Picadera Merengue (sampler platter with fried meats green plantains and yucca fries) and Queso Frito (fried cheese) to start our meal. The fried cheese was tasty (how can you go wrong with fried cheese?) but the various meats were over-grilled to the point of being dry and stiff. The plantains were nicely done but the yuvva fries could have been moister (having backpacked through Peru I know this is possible without sauce).  For entrees I got the Almejas (mussels) opting for Creole sauce for an authentic dish. The mussels were pretty fresh but the sauce was about 1 degree too salty. Good a first then you realize you're chugging water like a sorority girl just to make it through the next bite. On the flip side the Spanish rice with beans that came as my side was completely dry and tasteless. (I did combine the two when I took the rest of the dish home for leftovers and voila problem solved!)  Other dishes I tried included the Filete de Chillo al Gusto (red snapper filet) in both coconut and Creole sauce and both were very well done (meat nice and tender). The Chuletas de Cerdo Frita (center cut fried pork chops) were too dry and tough. The chicken mofongo came in a huge pyramid of ridiculous quantity but it was a bit too dry and tasteless for me.  So overall while I enjoyed trying out a cuisine I don't often get to have the food itself didn't seem very well-cooked. Perhaps it is a Dominican thing to have drier meats but I like my meat as tender as possible. Glad I came not in a rush to come back. Though that orange + evaporated milk concoction is pretty tasty.""]","['Went there for a birthday dinner recently and overall the food wasn\'t spectacular.  I got the grilled calamari which was a bit overcooked.  A couple of my friends got the steak and they claimed it was fairly decent so I guess it varies depending on what you order.    However my low rating really comes from service.  I would advise you double fist and order your ""drinks"" at one time because it will take an hour for your next round.  We ordered some appetizers to share across the table amongst 8 ppl and they gave us 2 plates with 2 forks - literally utensils for the two ppl who ordered for the table.  Needless to say we had to ask for more plates.  There were no refills on water and there were cases of poor attitude from the bus ladies who were clearing our table.    For the price of their entrees which really is not cheap (15-20) you could do better.  I wouldn\'t go back again.', ""Authentic Dominican food!!! The decor is so warm and welcoming inside kinda takes u back to DR =) The service is also very friendly nice and pretty quick. My fav dish to have is the berenjena asada but they don't don't make it all the time call ahead to see if it's on the menu that night. Spanish rice and the mofongo are also excellent. The platanos maduros are a bit dry. If you're in the mood for something sweet to drink try the morir sonado it's delicious!

We started with the sampler platter (Picadera Merengue) which was good to pick over as we waited for the entrees to come.  We then got the Mofongo (i wasnt a huge fan but another member in our group said they\'ve sampled mofongo ALL over and this place had the best).  the ""Ceviche de Camarones"" was very refreshing tasting and the Frituritas were good but the Queso y Salami Frito was only so-so.  My favorite dish was the sweet plaintains (Platanos Maduros). Again it was fantastic to have such a variety of dishes all very distinct and delicious!  As for beverages I got a ""fresh"" passionfruit drink - but I thought it was too sweet and didnt seem like 100% fruitjuice.   Only thing i wasnt a fan of was the location - its only on-street parking off a busy road or else you have to take a bus to get there; didnt seem like the safest neighborhood to be in either but during the day seemed fine.']","[""I'm Dominican but I eat Dominican food only rarely.

My experience with the service was not so good.  When we ordered there were no plates or settings and it took a while for bring them out while our appetizers were sitting on the table getting cold.  And it was just placed at the end of our table we had a group of 9.  The table wasn't that long but it was not handed out to us.  Alot of us ordered the Steak.  only one of them came with a steak knife.  We asked for knives so again food was just sitting there while we waited for a while for knives.    I had ordered mine with a side of fries.  But after my steak came out they than came to tell me that they had run out of fries would I like something else.  So I ordered fried plantaines instead.  I was pretty much done eating and no plantaines.    My friend had ordered a shake waited a while still no shake.  The waitress comes and tells her the manager is in the basement getting stuff ot make it or something to that extent.  10 minutes later still nothing.  Than finally came back and told us the machine was broken!  Still at this point no plantaines. We were all done eating and the check had came out.  I complained to my friend on the table about it and I guess the waitress heard me and came over and apologized and said sorry we already charged you though.    Uh - what was I suppose to say to that?  Still ended up paying for it even though we never got it.    So the experience that I had here was TERRIBLE.  But on the brighter side - the food was really good here.    The steak with the Chimichurri sauce was excellent and cooked perfectly."", ""O yes this is one of my favorite restaurants.

The Dominican Republic was colonized by Spain and they speak Spanish but the menu is very different then you'd find at a Spanish resteraunt.  Fortunately for me I like Dominican food.   It took a few minutes of standing there with the waitress and her boyfriend looking at me for her to come up and ask (via hand signals since her mouth was full of food) how many and if I wanted a table.  Some people probably would have been put off but I thought it was funny.    The dining room is large with red and blue walls and big paintings with lots of bright colors.  Its a bit crowded with big tables and oversized whicker chairs so if you're looking for quiet and privacy this probably isn't your spot.  When I first came in they were playing Latin pop fairly loudly but switched it to sort of light rock partway through.  Still fairly energetic but minus the 808's.  I ordered the grilled steak with peppers and onions a side of sweet fried plantains and a limonade (fresh lemonade) which to my delight tasted like it had been made with coconut juice.  Great combo if you haven't tried it.  The food was excellent and there was a lot of it.  Steak was a bit tough but that's not unusual for a latin-style thin-cut fried steak.  The grilled veggies that came with and the side of plantains i ordered balanced the flavors out perfectly.  I had enough leftovers to eat a small meal late at night at my hotel.  This is a great place and worth checking out."", ""I live in Dorchester so there are more than enough Dominican/Caribbean style restaurants around. However most of them are simply a counter with a few chairs. Not to say the food isn't great but the ambiance leaves alot to be desired. Luckily I just discovered Merengue which is actually a Dominican RESTAURANT. It's a decently sized place and was hoping when I went this past Sunday. The first thing I noticed was that my party was the only white people in the place which is clearly a good sign if you are getting Dominican food. And Merengue did not disappoint with great shrimp ceviche and fired cassava appetizers. My main course was a whole red snapper in creole sauce sure it's hard to pick around the bones but you can't beat the flavor! Like Miguel said it's def not cheap but the food is great and VERY filling."", 'Saturday night we didn\'t quite know what we wanted to eat but we definitely wanted another ""Cafe Cesaria experience"". Something ethnic and delicious and not expensive. After searching all the usual websites Abby found Merengue.  Located on Blue Hill Ave a short 7 minute drive from our condo we arrived to find easy street parking. (Crossing the street though wasn\'t as easy.) We entered in to find a bar area on the left and a dining area on the right. We get seated in a booth but are quickly asked to move to a smaller table because the entire booth was reserved. No biggie. The dining room is very colorful and there were plenty of people enjoying drinks and hanging out. This is definitely the type of place that it seems everyone there knew each other. (Sure enough in the middle of our meal a large group came in and the couple sitting next to us gave them all hugs and hellos and moved tables together so that they can eat together.)  The menu is big and with tons of options. Abby went with Filetillo (Steak Tips Cooked in Creole Sauce with Green Peppers Red Peppers and Onion) and I went with Chuletas a la Jardinera (Fried Pork Chop Garden Style Topped with Green Peppers Red Peppers and Onion). We probably should have gotten the Mofongos but completely forgot to order it. That was ok though because our sides (Spanish rice and white rice with beans) were plenty huge and both dishes came with a small salad too. We also ordered a drink that was very reasonably priced.  Our meals were fantastic. The pork while a couple of bites were dry was perfectly cooked with a nice crust. The white rice was plain but I cut up the pork along with some of the peppers and onions and ate it all together. Very nice. The beans also were delicious. Abby\'s steak was in a nice tomato-y sauce and was perfectly cooked as well. I didn\'t think the Spanish rice was anything special but she definitely did. Also the portions for both were huge. This was a great dinner.  Merengue met all expectations and is a spot I\'d come back to again. The service and the food was fantastic and well above average. The whole fish that our neighbor got looked amazing and I\'d like to give that a try next time. The prices were also in the sweet spot with most items around $10. I give Merengue a very very strong 3 and 1/2 out of 5.

Seems crazy considering that mediocre raw fish could have painful consequences so I guess that makes me a risk taker. Or just too lazy to walk to a 4-star joint.  Sanraku is tucked within the Metreon building with a nice view of Yerba Buena garden. Like most sushi joints the ambience is nothing to marvel at - it's simple clean and gets the job done. So let's talk sushi...  The menu is totally standard with some bento box lunch specials and your run-of-the-mill rolls. I always have to have my seaweed salad so I was lured by the special Sanraku seaweed salad claiming to have 3 different types of seaweed on a bed of greens. For $10 I had high hopes. Yes it came with 3 types of seaweed but in measly little portions; the majority of this pricey salad being lettuce not seaweed. The dressing was more acidic than flavorful and I couldn't wait for my sushi to arrive...this salad was just not cuttin' it.   We shared a few of the fancy rolls; you know the ones that Americans order (with spicy mayo sauce and tempura fried this and that). They were mostly delicious and definitely filled the sushi void. Service was sporadic (who exactly was our server? We weren't sure) and during the lunch rush that became a problem when we needed to jet back to the office for a meeting. Next time we'll tell them we're on a tight schedule maybe that'll help.  Pricey sushi considering the location. But if you're in the area and in desperate need of rawness Sanraku can fix you up in an A-OK fashion.""]","[""Sushi in the Metreon? You'd be surprised and amazed!

We can usually squish in a party of 8 or so and once the unpleasant business of rearranging the chairs and getting ourselves into our seats is done it actually doesn't feel that squished!  It has been said before but I'll say it again. Even though it's tacked onto the Metreon and the decor is kind of standardly facelessly Japanese the food is really quite good. The fish is fresh the miso is warm and salty and neither I nor my coworkers have ever had a bad dish to the best of my knowledge. The menu isn't that inventive but it has all your favorites - soba tempura California roll and all - prepared very nicely. They get a bit more creative with their special rolls of course and I even ordered the chef's pick sushi lunch last time and got something that (I think) contained squid tobiko and a hot sauce that was surprising and tasty. No not surprisingly tasty I was pretty sure I would like it.  In San Francisco which is also the land of a billion sushi restaurants you might not feel compelled to go out of your way to eat at Sanraku. But if you happen to be in the area and are looking for a sizeable reasonably-priced lunch comprised of standard Japanese fare by golly Sanraku might just be your place!""]","[""Food = good. (I enjoyed the yellowtail sesame chicken rock-n-roll roll and some stuff but I was a tad concerned by the nearly black color of the tuna roll.......)  Service = efficient.   Decor = simple.   Prices = moderate. Happy Hour is okay if you can figure out which items are actually a better value if you order more than one...;) (it's 3 to 7 p.m.) Most items are under $5"", ""When the BF told me that we were meet up with his college friends in the city at a Japanese place I was PSYCHED. I love sushi with a fiery passion and hadn't eaten it in awhile.   First we got sorta lost looking for the place. After going up a few floors in the Metreon then going outside and passing the door we found it. The door is a bit inconspicuous and doesn't quite look like the entrance to anything. And the restaurant is oddly shaped as other Yelpers have mentioned; it's long and skinny.   As soon as we got there and greeted the group rounds of hot sake were ordered and promptly downed. And after a few cups I realized the BF and I hadn't eaten anything! We finished off the rest of the appetizers (gyoza and some random rolls) then we all ordered our dinners.   The BF and I shared the sashimi salad deluxe (such delicious fresh fish with a great ginger vinaigrette) the rock 'n roll (eel &amp; avocado roll which was good but the brown eel sauce covered up the eel) and some miso soup (decent but not very hot). And he ordered some nigiri which was good even though I can't recall what fish it was.   The rest of the group ordered the dinner specials which included teriyaki of some type (salmon beef etc) with rice and steamed veggies sushi (sashimi or CA roll) and miso soup. I heard no complaints from them and they cleaned off their plates so I assume it was good!  And the hot sake. We managed to finished off 13 rounds of hot sake between 4 of us (2 of the girls stopped at 1 cup which is less than half a round). And we tried some nigori (unfiltered) sake which I prefer and the boys have sake bombs.   Our waiter Jin looked a bit bored. Or lifeless but he took care of us and our wild sake-downing mess. And I managed to crack a smile out of him when I asked him for water refills. Cuz our sake-loving friends surely needed some more water ;)  OH and it was HAPPY HOUR before 7 so that's why the guys ordered hot sake like crazy people! Needless to say our pre-gaming dinner was a blast."", ""Some times the cravings just come and shake me through and through and try as I might I can't shake em off. This is the source of desperation.  So I take a deep breath and enter the Metreon. That's right. Sushi in a megacomplex always tastes better right? Is that why there's always a ridiculous line? Can't be their sloppily wrapped rolls two (cali and rock &amp; roll) of which cost me $18. Oof.  Hard up. That's when I'll come here again considering there's no other decent place in the walkable vicinity. And to the gardens I will go toting my Sanraku take-out consoled by the bright sun and cool welcoming grass.""]","[""Located inside the Metreon. Best oyster shooters I've ever had hands down! Their soft shelled crab with the salsa was aaaaaaamazing too as well as the spicy scallop roll or whatever it was they made. But the oyster shooters and soft shelled crab were to die for!!!! The sushi chefs also loooove to joke around! Great relaxing place for a late lunch"", ""Seating was prompt but service was incredibly slow on a Saturday night. The staff was friendly and helpful but they definitely neglected to take my order and deliver it in any reasonable time frame. I sat at the sushi bar and had to wait 30 minutes to get the first piece of fish from the time I ordered. The food was delicious and I would recommend the Uwajima roll (hamachi cucumber ginger scallions) and the scallop nigiri.   All in all it was a decent spot for Japanese food if you're in the SoMa area or watching a movie at the Metreon."", ""Having sushi at Sanraku was like....having sushi at a mall. Nothing spectacular yet we could appreciate that it was available at the Sony Metreon before catching a movie on the 3rd floor.  When the wait staff finally noticed us at the table they were friendly and accommodating. I have a soy allergy which throws the staff a curve ball here and there but our server was very graceful about it.  At best the sushi can be described as generic yet a step up from picking up sushi at the super market. With that said highlights included the spicy scallop roll and the monk fish liver and the regrets were absolutely the spider roll and the uni. Interestingly enough I could even criticize the rice here which was poorly seasoned and in general I'm not one to dwell much on rice.   I'd recommend getting the Katana a nice sake but get a big bottle if you're two at it. The small is very small.  Conclusively the bonus here was that I didn't have to settle for a Starbucks or popcorn dinner so thanks Sanraku for being around.""]","[""Really enjoyed my meal here last night. Had the mitsuri roll tonkatsu and nabeyaki udon. Wanted to rate it a bit higher but the nabeyaki udon didn't have bamboo shoots in it nor an egg! (My girlfriend is a bit of a connoisseur). Tonkatsu was good - no complaints there. The only thing about the mitsuri roll was that I could taste the propane on it.. but it was still pretty good.  The place seems to have a really good happy hour so I'll definitely be back to check that out!"", 'May be biased as I have worked down here for years... but Sanraku\'s sushi noodles and sesame chicken are all standouts!  SUSHI: Fish is all very high quality. Go for the 49er roll for fresh Bogi roll for savory and Hanabi Roll for smooth.   SESAME CHICKEN: I was in NJ and told a gentleman in the food and beverage business that I lived in SF. He said ""Do you know where to find the bests sesame chicken in the country? Sanraku"". It is very good fried savory served with salad. Get the combo with sashimi and you won\'t be disappointed.  NOODLES: The Nabayaki Udon is off the hook on a cold day. Tip from LL take the shrimp out ASAP to prevent from getting too soggy. Tip from me bury the egg deep down in the bowl to let it cook if you do not want a runny egg.', ""Plain and simple this is a nice little place! The service is a little slow. We wound up serving ourselves water when it became difficult to get anyone's attention. The food is very good though --- high quality delicious and worth the price.   I enjoyed the Sushi Lover's Platter (California roll tuna yellow tail salmon shrimp eel &amp; egg omelet). Hubby gave two thumbs up to the amazing udon probably the best deal on the menu! For just $11 you get a huge serving!!   One way in which this place has been totally remiss is that there is no children's menu. How could this be? There were so many families in the place while we dined. The Zeum is also located just across the street Yerba Buena offers a plethora of children's programming in its gardens and with the movie theaters and video arcades housed in the building there is certainly enough of a population to tap into. Come on Sanraku pull one together please! In the meanwhile I advise that you do as we did --- split an adult-sized dinner between two kids.""]","['tempura', 'tempura', 'tempura']","['sake', 'sake', 'sake']","['california', 'california', 'california']","['shrimp', 'shrimp', 'shrimp']","['spicy tuna', 'tuna roll', 'tuna spicy']","['hamachi', 'hamachi', 'hamachi']","['francisco', 'francisco', 'francisco']","['rock', 'rock', 'rock']","['scallop', 'scallop', 'scallop']","['egg', 'egg', 'egg']"

The pizza most certainly NEVER sits out as previously mentioned (don\'t assume it just to slam it). We\'ve nearly almost gotten a fresh slice from the fired oven as they go through a lot of food and constantly are making new pizzas.   Someone mentioned their cheese pizza was oily?

I don\'t mind the hours they are open and in fact I\'m glad they cater to a late night munchies crowd especially in this hood. (The only downside is that by that time there is not much to choose from as it\'s all sold out - which proves my point again their pizza sells out and does NOT sit out).   What\'s funny is that we actually had a pepperoni and veggie pizza earlier today for a snack and it was superb. I must mention again they this crust is simply divine.
