While I waited for the other 24 to arrive, they checked on my, made sure I had beverages, etc.  The the entire group, a youth arts group from Africa, showed up, and we were off and running. The wait staff was not only super friendly and efficient, they also seemed completely unfazed by how large the groups was or the fact that most of the kids speak limited English.  The artistic director of the group was celebrating his graduation from college that evening. The staff brought him Flan with a candle on it, turned out the lights, seranaded him, patted him on the back, applauded him. It made him feel so very special.

My dine in experiences here have always been fulfilling.  Ordering take out has aways been a gamble for me though. I can aways count on something being \u00a0questionable about my order. They either give me the overcooked chicken, or the greener harder plantains, or short me on them, or the sauce. Check your order before walking out of the door. order from here at least twice a month and that always seems to happen.Management here needs to start giving the same level of attention to take out quality control as they do their in diners.They also give me funny looks when i ask for bread with my takeout order.

After eating there I swore I would never go back....but a friend invited us to dinner and I agreed to give it a shot.   The chicken was so much more tastier and flavorful here. The tangy lemon garlic sauce was amazing. I loved the freshly sliced onions that topped the chicken and even apologized to my boyfriend before hand because I knew my breath would be kicking later. We tried the Moro this time as a side and I liked it better then the side of white rice and black beans. It was essentially the same but the white rice was cooked with the black beans and loaded with flavor.   We had a huge party of 20 on a Saturday night. Service was great.

For starters, they give you garlic bread and even this is oh, so delicious. I can't help but ask for more after more after more. It goes great with the black beans they provide with your dish.  The restaurant always has a hustle-and-bustle feel. Servers are always on their feet making sure customers are satisfied with their meals and if they need anything else. I'm not kidding.

My husband and I were passing through and decided to try this place because of a friends suggestion.  Everything from the warm toasty buttery bread, cafe con leche, tostones was awesome .   I am a privileged Puerto Rican from the California bay area and I was lucky enough to have grown up eating my grandmothers authentic delicious food so I can spot a fake in a heart beat! (Cuban food and Puerto Rican food very similar)  This place was delicious, the spices were just right, the meats tender and juicy. The service was prompt and friendly. The ambiance clean, lively, and colorful.   I will definitely \u00a0be back when I'm in the area."}, {"date": "2012-01-31", "rating": 4, "comment": "I still love the ambiance, the service (very attentive and easy to grab when you want something, like extra buttery bread or water), and the food. I still get the chicken with yellow rice ($11.99--prices have gone up but quality seems more consistent as a result), with the chicken cooked to the point that it basically falls off the bone without being dry. The rice is very flavorful and wonderful, and if you like plantains, they are a perfect mix of sweet and sour. The garlic chicken (or other meat) seems better than I remember; before it was so lemony that I couldn't touch it without puckering. But, now it seems quite good, mixed with very fresh (aka potent) slices of white onion. To tone down the flavor a bit, I would encourage you to go for the pork rather than chicken, or perhaps get the combo and try both ($13.99). The mango and guanabana smoothies are a bit pricier than I recall, now a little bit steep at $3.99, and are rather dilute and weak in flavor. If you want to try something new and richer, go for the mamey. Overall, aside from parking, which can be tight if you are able to get a spot and the high volume of conversation inside, it is a good place with good food in good portions. I will likely be back another time for dinner and perhaps for happy hour, for I noticed they have $3 mojitos from 6-8pm!!"}, {"date": "2011-12-19", "rating": 5, "comment": "Still one of my favorite places to eat in LA!

Darn, now I want some chicken . . ."}, {"date": "2011-11-26", "rating": 5, "comment": "Sangria, Plantains, and best of all, Bob Saget.  I've been coming here for several years now, and I have always loved this place. The menu has stayed the same, but visually has changed drastically! It started off as a dingy paper menu years ago but now it's fancy, complete with pictures!  Let me just say first of all that the parking situation here, particularly on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday night, is terrible. Thankfully I live a short walking distance away so I take a stroll out there every now and then to enjoy a glass (or pitcher!) of sangria. Thankfully I am a stone's throw away from this Versailles location.  More on the sangria. It just has the right taste. Just enough sweetness, plenty of tang, with a few slices of orange. I can plow through this like fruit punch, hell almost like water. It's dangerous. Being a brand new graduate student at UCLA a few years ago, there was nothing better than driving over (yep, dangerous) to Versailles (when I didn't live anywhere near it) and having a pitcher of sangria for $14.99 after a hard day. Unfortunately, those days are over. I can't handle a pitcher of sangria anymore, merely a glass or two. But to my benefit, I don't spend as much money. The sangrias prices have upped to $19.99 per pitcher and remained at about $3.99 per glass.  Also... their bread! Devastatingly simple. They cut off pieces of freshly (daily) baked bread, toast it and spread some butter sauce on top. Just enough to get it a little soaked, but make the paper they deliver it on absolutely clear. Yes, some cardiac arrest is in the works, but oh so worth it at Versailles. Sometimes I must ask for a second order.  I usually stick with the whole chicken, the roast pork, or the fried pork chunks (sorry, I can't remember the numbers) and I am always happy. ALWAYS. You may think that is \"oil\" at the bottom of your roast pork or chicken pile, but no, that is their special marinade, dubbed \"Mojo sauce\". It is a very tangy, lemon-y mixture that they grill, fry, and cook everything with at their establishment.  Even more fantastic is that they include with nearly every dish, a solid helping of moro (black beans within!) rice, and my personal favorite, plantains! You may not expect it, but mix the beans and rice together, and with the excess dip your plantains. Heck, dip your plantains in the excess moro sauce. Soaking up the tangy/salty juices along with the contrast of the sweet plantains? HEAVEN. Absolute perfection.  Another dish I also enjoy here (and had tonight!) is the Cuban Sandwich. A nice helping of pickles, swiss cheese, and mustard on a 9-10 inch roll along with a generous slice of ham and roasted pork leg to top it off. Throw on some tapatillo sauce and some ketchup for your fries and you've got yourself a perfect meal that you can take on the go in a pinch! I've done that meal for lunch many times, switching off to the Bistec (steak) sandwich as well as the roast pork sandwich. Fortunately they recently updated the menu to allow you to get the sandwich/fries meal for dinner. For many years, this was not possible and they told you so.  And what do you know?! A celebrity sighting! Bob Saget and his girlfriend were sitting at the table behind us. They had the whole chicken and the roasted pork. I like his choices (AND his style)!  I go back here at least once every couple of weeks. Unfortunately I have to limit myself... I don't want to get too tired of Versailles!"}, {"date": "2011-12-09", "rating": 1, "comment": "Bad Service and Bad Food = Major Fail.  We got seated and figured out quickly what we wanted to order. I raised my hand like a good 4th grade student but everyone ignored me. \u00a0My friend tried to flag down a server and even after making eye contact with 2, no one came to help us. Eventually, a server who was helping the table next to us stopped by to take our order.  I got the Tamales appetizer (2 pork tamales) and my friend ordered Bistec de Pollo.  My tamales were ok but there was very little pork. \u00a0In fact, I would say that pork made up about 5% of each tamal. \u00a0The sauce it was in was not bad but the abundance of completely raw onions on top of the dish was not appetizing.  My friend's chicken was hard, cold and not good at all. \u00a0He said that he could make better chicken at home and he's no gourmet chef. \u00a0It was also topped with enough onions to make an army cry but at least his onions were slightly cooked. \u00a0The plantains that came with the dish were pretty good but how can anyone mess up frying plantains, right?

I was very excited to try Versailles, been on the bookmark list for a while! Of course, I ordered the Garlic Chicken #6 and it didn't disappoint. The restaurant is pretty chill, nice atmosphere. Nothing fancy and nothing dumpy. Just a nice relaxing place to have a hearty/tasty meal.   -The Bread that they give you to start off with was pretty good. The bread itself was warm and toasty, just way to much butter on it though! It almost tasted like Popcorn from the theaters. It's just too much in my opinion before dinner.   -The Garlic Chicken was good. It didn't \"Blow\" me away, but it was for sure tasty. Other reviews were not lying when they said this thing was garlicky! Damn, I for sure wouldn't go here on a date for the first time and get this. Unless I was married or had been dating a girl for a long time! You could kill someone with that garlic baby! The chicken was moist on the inside and perfect combo of soft and crispy skin on the outside. I really enjoyed it flavors, maybe just a tad less garlic though.   -The rice that comes with it was good. Nothing special, it could have been cooked a little bit more but never the less was decent. The beans that came with the dish were not that special on their own by any means, very runny. So I decided to mix the beans in with the white rice. This came together well and made both taste much better. The plantains were good, but I have had better. They put them on the side of the chicken so all that garlic/lemony zest gets mixed in and it didn't taste good, at all. They just don't go well together. The plantains were somewhat soggy. I wasn't a big fan of the Raw onions on top of the chicken, I just moved them off to the side.  -The service was very friendly and very quick. the food doesn't seem to take too long which is good if you aren't into making it a long dinner. It seems like a good spot for a quick bite, but not for a date if you are like trying to get to know someone and maybe want a more intimate setting.

I opted for the classic dish: Lomo Salteado - Rib Eye Steak  Simmered in tomato sauce with onions and bell peppers and served atop fried potatoes.  It was just plain delicious.

I ordered the lech\u00f3n asado, which was very well seasoned but a bit dry for my taste.

Since I only ate a third of my plate and a friend gave me a third of hers, I had enough lech\u00f3n and onions to experiment with the next day. For lunch, I browned the onions and reheated the pork in it for a bit, making the onions much more palatable and the pork a tiny bit less dry. For dinner, I put the remaining pork on a sandwich--also yummy.  Next time, I'll order the ropa vieja. If they could manage to make ropa vieja dry... they wouldn't have gotten such good ratings.

As everyone says, the bread is ridiculously good: crusty, buttery and bottomless. We didn't request more, but it just kept coming. Then we had the idea to dip it in their cilantro cream sauce, which just made it to die for. $1.50 for a side of the most amazing cilantro cream sauce I've ever had? A bargain!  We ordered the Famoso Pollo Versailles with Moro and the Lomo Salteado with beans and rice to share. For me, the chicken with the garlicky lemony sauce and fresh onions was really interesting, but the acidity of the sauce takes getting used to (and I love anything acidic) so it wasn't something I was ready to eat an entire portion of. I'd definitely eat it again, and luckily my friend is in love with it. However, the Lomo Salteado \u00a0was right up my alley on a windy evening, warm and stewy. Next time I'll skip the fries (which would be great if I wanted to be fat), because blending the beans, rice, and tomato-y sauce together made the most delicious mashed up rice side dish ever. The ribeye steak pieces were tender but not mushy (I like my meat to bite back a bit), and went amazingly with the cilantro cream sauce. The bits of pepper, tomato, and onion were stewed to perfection, and we both had leftovers for lunch.  I know everyone recommends the Moro, but I actually preferred the rice and beans separate, then mixing them myself, because the rice was much more moist and fluffy that way. The service was pretty good, though a little slow to take our order, and they refilled our drinks readily. She even described how to make the cilantro cream sauce at home, which I'm definitely going to try.

What do you eat in a new restaurant that everyone rates? \u00a0Their speciality of course, and in Versailles it was a Garlic chicken.  Half a roasted chicken in their lemony-garlicky sauce, with fried plantains, rice and beans. \u00a0Fantastic. \u00a0The chicken sauce was light but very full flavoured and the meat moist and drop off the bone. \u00a0The sides were perfect also.

But after a few weeks out of Miami, we were craving Cuban food enough to try some. Having a Versailles in Miami, it was a no brainer as to where we would go.  The decor and the music were great. Mexican waiters in guayaberas? Super cute! Seriously, the service was pretty good-definitely with better attitudes than the Cuban joints in Miami. They were out of the Matervas we ordered \u00a0, but before we could say anything, our waiter suggested a Jupi\u00f1a. Nicely done.  We weren't that hungry to order meals and were in the mood for a sandwich so we ordered an order (2) of croquettas, an order (2) of tamales, and a pan con bistec (steak sandwich).  They brought out the necessary Cuban meal staple: bread and butter, but it wasn't Cuban bread. Eh, I didn't pay mind to it because it was nice and full of buttery goodness.  The tamales came out first. They were much bigger than my husband and I were used to ever having eaten. On a positive note, it did have more meat than we had ever had in a tamale. Delicious. A little hot sauce is the perfect companion.  Next came our croquettas. Sadly, we were disappointed in these. They were small and their taste was reminiscent of a familiar frozen brand. While somewhat disappointed at the size and taste, I AM biased because I love croquettas and have rarely found an inedible one.  Finally, our pan con bistec came-we did share the sandwich. Before talking about that, I do have to mention that the sandwich selection was very tiny. I don't even think I saw a Media Noche on there (unless I looked over it)-that's just crazy. Back to the sandwich, the steak itself was delicious!! Perfectly marinated and a perfect consistency. Unbelievable!!  They added cheese upon our request and it was good. I can't speak for myself regarding the grilled onions as I don't eat them, but my husband says they are not TOO grilled or soft, therefore leaving a slight crunchiness to the sandwich. What just made me a little sad was that that sandwich did NOT use Cuban Bread. WHAT WHAT WHAT?!?! That is where I draw the line. A pan con bistec made with bread other that Cuban is insanity. Oh well, thanks to the steak, the sandwich was, indeed, tasty. The bread used was a little chewy.  Folks seem to be raving over the garlic chicken and they even have oxtail on the menu.

I was impressed by the flavor of their moro since i just though it would taste like rice and beans.. it didnt. It definitely had more flavor than i thought it would have.   my boyfriend got the #1 Pork order off their menu. it was supposed to be garlic flavored pork or something.. i thought his pork was really flavorful; almost too flavorful. it almost had a salty taste to it since there was so much flavor.   hmm overall i think this is a good place to eat cuban food. it seems pretty authentic to me"}, {"date": "2010-07-14", "rating": 4, "comment": "Stopped here for Cuban tonight after getting a recommendation from some friends.

Cool sign with its huge obtrusive (in a good way) logo on the outside. Old-school homey interior, friendly staff ... I dig all that stuff.   But, I keep hearing and reading how the Versailles lemon-roasted chicken is so good. Well, I've had it twice and not only can I not recommend it, but I will not eat it again. It's not so BAD, it's just NOT GOOD and that makes me sad.   The chicken arrives at your table and by its appearance, you're just ready to dive in. Carcass intact, golden-brown skin, adorned with sliced raw onions... Then you take a bite. Hmmm... pretty dry... not much flavor. Well, maybe just the breast meat is dry... that's passable I guess (actually in a restaurant it shouldn't be passable). So I go for the thigh, my favorite part of a chicken. Dark meat's gotta be juicy, right? Wrong. Dry again! Are you kidding me???   Saddened by this (and somewhat desperate at this point), I cut off some meat from the drumstick, tear off a good amount of skin to accompany it, put some of the raw onion on top, drag it through the lemon sauce and go for it. Okay not bad, but again, do you want to go out to eat and have \"not bad\"? I don't.   I should mention here that the lemon sauce shouldn't really be thought of as \"sauce\", let's be honest. It's actually just half a notch above lemon juice. It kinda tastes like the lemon juice that comes in those plastic lemons with the green cap at the supermarkets. Toss in some garlic powder... there you have it.  My friends still love that chicken though. Actually, I am envious. I want to like it. I guess my opinion of the lemon chicken at Versailles is best summarized in this (partial) quote by Jonathan Gold of LA Weekly:  \"Everybody but me, it appears, adores the crisp-skinned roast chicken at he Cuban restaurant Versailles...\"  Why not pan the place?

Its hard to really complain about this because a lot of the flavor comes from the oil itself.  The best part is the price.

The chicken arroz con pollo was one of the best I've had. The rice was perfectly cooked and seasoned with juicy chicken falling off the bone. The coffee latte was excellent.   The 2 let downs were the beef stew (meat was too chewy) and the french fries which were over cooked inside even though the outside looked okay.  My favorite was the flan with the coconut shaved topping. The flan was eggy to the right amount with lots of caramel sauce but the kicker was the shaved coconut heap at the top.

They come with black beans, rice and fried plantains on the side. Although I would rather have a double helping of the plantains and forgo the beans, they don't allow any substitutions here.   Also parking is really cramped and large cars smash into compact spaces ALL THE TIME. Sad to say that a few of our cars have suffered minor casualties with a few extra dings and scratches that weren't there pre-dining.  The place is pretty crowded at dinner time, even during the week! Loud rambunctious restaurant which is good for group dinners, just have to wait for a table.  Minus one star for obnoxious creepy wait staff. They blatantly stare at all the girls and make you feel dirty. YUCK. Yum for the food though. Make that YUM YUM for the food. Sigh. My mouth is watering just writing this review.

It's one thing to have a bustling restaurant, but it's completely different when it's just noise--people yelling to talk to one another, someone working there throwing utensils in the bin after they are dried--it was a little much. Maybe I'm just getting too old...  The food here wasn't particularly great either. I did like the garlicky bread they brought to the table at the beginning. In fact, I ate all of it myself, but the remainder of the meal was lackluster. I ordered the ropa vieja. Good ropa vieja should be extremely tender and flavorful. Versailles ropa vieja was flavorful with lots of tomato and bell pepper, but very chewy. My jaw was literally aching at the end of the meal because the meat was so chewy. I think the rice was a bit on the undercooked side, but the black beans and plantains were fine. In fact, I really liked the plantains, and those were the only thing I managed to finish.  What really capped off my experience here was seeing someone who worked at the restaurant blow their nose and walk back and touch stuff without washing his hands in between.

Otherwise though, the servers here have always been nice to us, they aren't great, but never horrible.

I have to add that one time I came in with friends not knowing they were about to close (place still had a decent amount of people, but we didn't realize they were mostly finished). They still served us and as the place cleared out didn't even pester us to leave or put up chairs in our section. I hate being \"those people\" who walk in right before closing, but they were surprisingly cool with it.  Everyone on here has probably talked about the garlic chicken. So yeah, get it-- preferably on a first date then you can REALLY test out how understanding he/she is. They give large portions, so I think it's worth what you pay.

I've heard that some locations are better than others, I've heard that it's the greatest Cuban food ever, I've heard it's not so great at all.... I realized it was time to form my own opinion of this place.  A couple of disclaimers: I've only been to the Venice Blvd location and I've never actually eaten in the restaurant, only take-out.   When I think \"take-out,\" I usually think fast food, pizza, Chinese, or Thai. I love all four but if you take out often (as I do), these options get a bit old. So I was very happy to discover that Versailles, just down the street from my apartment, is big in the take-out business (when I go in to pick up my order, there are often just as many people at the takeout counter as there are eating in-house).   Service is always fast.. they usually tell you over the phone that your order will be ready in 10-15 minutes, so as soon as I hang up the phone, I start walking.   I'm a fan of the picadillo.... a hearty, filling stew made with ground beef, potatoes and tomato sauce. Each entree is served with fried plantains, rice and beans,and everything (except a couple of seafood dishes) is priced under $15.

All of this was washed down with a delicious guanabana (one of my most favorite fruits of all time- white flesh, big black seeds, flavor reminiscent of coconut/berries/pineapple) shake ($3.50). \u00a0  Affordable. \u00a0Down to earth. \u00a0Delicious. \u00a0Los Angeles.

But listen to this here.... this is what you have to do. order a side of the garlic sauce. It's basically the sauce they use on the garlic chicken. it's spicy, garlicky..there's some lemon all up in there. So what you do is spoon a little of the garlic sauce onto your rice. let it soak it up. then put some beans on it. I call it flavor layering...... That with the beef stew,sweet plantains..and sangria.. ack ! it's so good.  Additionally.. last night my friend ordered the avocado salad. which is for you if you love avocado because plainly...that's what it is. just a sliced up avocado with some raw onions. They give you oil and vinegar to dress it. she also had them bring her a plate of lemons to use with the oil and vinegar as a dressing. it tasted awesome ! \u00a0salty..zesty and creamy...

The garlicky-lemony marinade is what makes this meal so tasty and I like when the platanos (fried plantains) get all mixed up in it.  If I could go back again, though, I would go for the chunks of pork (I think it's #1 on the current menu), which I tried at least once. I love Mexican carnitas and this shares some of that citrus/pork flavor combination that I love.  I've had their sangria and it was OK. If you have a long drive home, I will caution you on topping a big meal of citrusy/garlicky fiber-filled food with sangria and espresso. Nuff said.

Keep in mind that this chicken is really full of flavor so don't order it if you don't think you can handle all excess of cirtrus, garlic, and onion goodness.

I can honestly say that I have eaten dinner at Versailles more than at any other restaurant on earth. Yeah, I now live in the neighborhood, Palms (a district unexpectedly replete with fine, moderately priced restaurants) but when I've resided elsewhere, I've driven here, happily, for the great food and sunny Cuban service.  I'm not really going to wax gastronomic here. You've read all the other reviews and I concur with just about all of them, 4 stars and better. Suffice it to say, the #6 chicken is absolutely amazing. Take a dinner home and you'll have 2 and-a-half dinners or 3 lunches that'll last you half the work week. Of course, you might not want to down this fare if you're trying to impress anyone with your breath - you'll burp skunk for 12 hours - but if minty freshness isn't your stated goal, go for it! The lechon asado, for those of you who eat pork, is straight from pig heaven. Just about everything else served here comes highly recommended. Down it all with a Malta Hatuey and you're stylin' - Cuban style, that is.  William, \"El Jefe\" at Versailles, is a great guy. I've seen him at the Venice shop a few times in recent months and his mood seems to have turned down with the turn down of the economy. People just haven't been showing up as they did in the past. Things, indeed, are tough all over and it's troubling to see the restaurant without its customary line out the door.  I'm sure business will pick up again as people venture out less tentatively in coming months, so here's a gentle reminder to support your local Versailles - whether you're in the city, the valley or down the coast a might - through the lean times.

The lamb was fully cooked but still very tender and it retained the sauce very well. The sauce was a little bit spicy, a little sour but very powerful. I could taste the sauce with every bite of lamb and I felt that the two went perfectly together. The rice was good, it was lightly seasoned with salt and lime which I appreciated very much. I like a place that pays attention to small detail, a lot of places neglect the rice so it was nice that this place took the time to lightly season the rice to give it a little extra. The black beans were excellent as well. They were cooked but not all all mushy and they too were lightly seasoned.

They make a few things that get the amazing reputation and a bunch of other stuff that nobody ever orders.  The two standouts are the Garlic Chicken and Cuban Roast Pork. Versailles has many other menu items like Lomo Saltado and Oxtail, but most are disappointing and take a lot longer to get out of the kitchen. (Oxtail is indeed a rich and tasty exception.) Skip them for the two standouts above.  Unless it's late in the evening, the chickens are turned out of the kitchen so often that it's rare you'll get an overcooked bird. Usually the chickens are juicy and crunchy-skinned, slathered with garlic sauce and are way too much for one person. Drawback: rice, plantains and beans on the side don't soak up the amazing sauce, so you have to scoop them into the chicken plate yourself. Messy.  The Roast Pork is similar, fork-tender and succulent, garlicky as all get-out, in bed with a huge serving of white rice and plantain slices. Dump in some black beans and you're all set. You'll take half the plate home as leftovers inless your name is Shaq.  Inside tip: they'll offer onions to go with your plate; ask to get them grilled...like In-N-Out, grilled onions give just the right sweetness to balance out that spicy garlic sauce.

The plantains do not have as much flavor or caramelization as I would like them to have.  I have also had their cuban sandwhich and its so-so.

Pick the table of our choice and I order a much deserved Bohemia (Cuban beers don't exist here...apparently) \u00a0and the Yucca Frita for the table... Cold Bohemia, hot yucca....life is good thus far.... Two of my veggiesaurus sisters order the only two veggie options on the menu (bananas and salad?) and my fellow meatasaurus orders up the 1/2 pollo en salsa barbacoa (Sweet n Juicy roasted half chicken with BBQ!) and I opt for the Pan con Lechon Samich (Shredded Roasty Pork on Cuban Bread with grilled onions!) \u00a0Now...Dudes....i kid you not....I hardly nibble on some yucca and sip on my brew when in mere minutes ALL of our food is upon us! \u00a0Our humble clan is all near starvation thanks to MAPQUEST(BOO!)....and we all happily dig in! The roast pork is too much.....too much good stuff....think carnitas torta... cuban style....magnifique! The siblings all give the universal \"thumbs up\" after all is said and done....and all is well and good for Cuban cuisine in honor of US Presidents Day =) Viva Fidel! haha."}, {"date": "2009-04-13", "rating": 2, "comment": "I tried Versailles for the first time almost seven years ago, and didn't go back until last night. \u00a0Some of my friends love this restaurant so much that I decided to give it another shot. \u00a0Anyways, I should have stayed away. \u00a0The food was borderline decent. \u00a0I ordered the garlic chicken with tostones instead of plantains and also a side of yuca fries. \u00a0The tostones and yuca fries were yummy. \u00a0Everything else was not. \u00a0I just couldn't stomach the garlic sauce. \u00a0It didn't have enough tang to it, and it was also extremely gooey. \u00a0But maybe I just feel this way because my palate is just too used to El Rincon Criollo."}, {"date": "2010-09-16", "rating": 4, "comment": "LOVE THIS PLACE.

Cubans.  If you believe that this restaurant is authentic Cuban food ... then you haven't ever really dined on good Cuban food. \u00a0There are several Cuban restaurants scattered throughout the Los Angeles County area. \u00a0Those of you whose only experience with Cuban food is what you get from Versailles are sorely in need of an eye-opener.  Versailles has a grilled chicken breast 'steak' that's not as loaded with salt as most of everything else on the menu (the sodium-crazy 'lechon asado' holds first place on that list) and any beef steak dish I've tried has featured a thin, tough and dry meat; but Versailles on Venice has become popular because it's on the Westside of Los Angeles.  I could not post this opinion without clicking on a rating star, so I gave it one star. \u00a0However, if there was such a rating as a MINUS-star, that's what I would have given it.  P.S. I noticed in some comments on the Versailles chain that \u00a0its French name was a puzzle in relation to the cuisine. \u00a0For those of you who are not familiar with things Cuban, the \"Versailles\" title refers to a pre-Castro landmark in Habana."}, {"date": "2009-11-08", "rating": 4, "comment": "First off, I am Cuban-American.

Whoever the little old lady is that created their marinates and sauces is a saint. \u00a0However, just like with most restaurants, I believe you have to know what to order to get the great experience. The things I order frequently are the Pork Chunks(masa de puerco), Roast Pork(lechon or puerco asado), Oxtails(rabo), Garlic Chicken, and Chicken and Rice. \u00a0I have listed these in order of preference.

OK, I'm sorry, how hard is it to figure out that the rice is cold and we want another? Really? From then on the service was terrible. We ate to the sound of the bored waitstaff (it was slow) cursing in Spanish the entire time and then having the waitress practically chuck the check at us. No one came by to check if we needed drink refills, they took condiments off our table while we sitting there and in general it was an altogether rude and unpleasant dining experience from the multiple people that served us (was everyone taking a turn?)  Now, I still like the food but for shitty service like this and for the price (which isn't exactly dirt cheap), it's not worth the trouble.

Pillowy and sweet plantains accompany your garlicky-lemony-awesome falling off of the bone pork. \u00a0If you like beans (my stomach detests them, so I can't vouch for beans) their black bean sauce smells smokey to go over the tender rice. \u00a0I am giving this a 5 because Versailles is NOT pretentious, is NOT a scene and is very comfortable and has great food with decor being second to the food. \u00a0You gotta try it. \u00a0I know this is their 1,000th review, or so but I am sending high accolades to this Cuban star of delish."}, {"date": "2010-06-20", "rating": 4, "comment": "The food here lives up to the high ratings.

Meh.\" \u00a0I had been to Madres, and I've always been a little turned off by rice and beans. Especially in a resturaunt.  Why would I go out and pay a 300% markup for poor people food? Add fried bananas, and I just really would rather not. I eventually gave in though :\"they have sangria and mojitos? Why did'cha say so before?\" So there we were, squeezing into a parking spot -the lot is inadequate, like everything transportation related in West LA.  I saw why when we went in. The place is brightly -obnoxiously painted, loud, full of happy, portly, down-home customers, and buzzing with literally dozens of waiters and bussers. \u00a0It feels like a circus tent -fun. But to the food.   In my experience, garlic and butter can make anything wonderful, and that's the common thread in most of the dishes I've tried here. Actually, \u00a0the dishes are almost all prepared \u00a0the same way, just different meat. The waiters are friendly and effiicent -they immediately drop a basket of sliced bread that has been :-] drizzled with garlic and butter :-] I think maybe they don't speak English, but that's ok with us. We always get what we came for. I like to watch all the mountains of food coming out of the kitchen. It ALL looks wonderful, and people look so happy when that big ol plate is plunked down in front of them. Seriously. They just light up.  The only thing that dissapointed me once was a salad I ordered. I like my salad, somethimes I just need one before my meal. It was really small and not treally what I consider a salad. I think it was more like half an avodado, a few slices of tomato, and a few rings of that white onion that's on everything else. It wasn't bad -just different. However:   You CANNOT go wrong with their signature chicken dish.   Its 1/2 chicken (I think rotisseried) smothered with this lemony -garlicy-buttery juice -and then scattered with sliced raw onions. I know it sounds harsh, but it actually works. On the side you get a little dish of black beans, which are actually quite well spiced and lovely, plantains -(whatever, I'm not a fan of those, but I'll eat them here) and white rice -which I would \u00a0usually abrupty push away were it not for all that sauce spilling over on it. It takes on a whole new meaning. I often get the calamari steak and eat the whole thing but bring home the rice to have for lunch the next day. It is so freaking satifying.   Try Versailles. Its so good and \u00a0simple. Do you want sangria? Do you want butter and garlic? Of course. Now all you have to decide is whether you want pork, chicken, beef or seafood with it.

And the pitchers were always in those plastic clear huge pitcher thingys. So, this time, the pitcher comes out in a small caraft. We asked the waiter, \"we wanted the pitcher not this\" and he replied \"this is the liter size\" we say \"we ordered the pitcher?\" and he says, \"oh, you don't want the pitcher, it's $60\" But he said it with a heavy accent and we were really confused...so.... Our response, \" Whaaaa? Six - Zero? or One Six?\" He said \"Six - Zero\". \u00a0We were glad he clarified that. Whoa, they took away the amount of alcohol and charge more. I didn't mind the portion size of the food but the portion size and price of the Sangria had me in fight mode. $60 bucks for a pitcher of Sangria. It used to be $17 -$19 bucks...I don't remember how much exactly...I just know it used to be under $20 bucks for a pitcher. Who would pay that? That's like a nice bottle of wine at a fancy schmancy restaurant. \u00a0I never thought to write a review for this place cause I always eat there and I neglect to write reviews for places I have been eating at for a long time(bad yelper i am)...but I felt like I had to let ya'll know what the 411 was on the Sangria.  The food is not always consistent. Sometimes you have a great meal and sometimes, it's meh....it's definitely worth a try just to see if you like it. Just don't get the $60 Sangria Pitcher."}, {"date": "2011-08-02", "rating": 5, "comment": "Yummy craving Versailles grub while I write this review!!

Versailles is quite the treat. Since I'm lucky enough to eat Cuban regularly, I've grown attached to my moros y cristianos. Slather on some mojo and I'm set.   It was really easy to find, big painted Versailles is clearly visible on Venice Blvd. The parking lot on the other hand, narrow and full. Was expecting a long wait and slow service. Au contraire. We were seated immediately, and service was just as quick to please. Matervas all around, sampler platter and then the platano platter. Oh boy, were we in heaven. A little bit of everything: un papa rellena, yuca frita (regular and stuffed; woah stuffed so goooooood), \u00a0tamal, croquettas and delicous chunks of fried pork. Fried plantains stuffed with lechon asado and ropa vieja. I love fried yuca, sooooooooo much. I was stuffed after the appetizers. For the main I ordered the combinacion pollo y puerco. Oh my. I could be nothing but happy at a place which can give me such moist pork and such succulent chicken. And since there was a battle going on in my belly and on my plate I couldn't help but get some more mojo on the side to make everything all wet. \u00a0For dessert I had the arroz con leche.

I thought it was \u00a0pretty good, though the bread tasted particulalry dry that evening.  We ordered: - Lechon Asado - Garlic Chicken and pork combo - the #6; forget what it's called, but it was like half a rotisserie chicken  Sides come with plantains and moro or rice w/beans. I thought the plantains were really delicious. The moro tasted great since it had the beans already mixed in with the rice, however the chicken was a bit dry for me. The portion sizes are huge! I never finished my #6 plate because of all the protein and carbs. When I saw the raw onions I was hesitant about eating them, but after taking a few bites, I found that the lime/lemon marinade tamed the strong taste of the onions  For dessert, we got the tres leches...it was rather on the dry side and tasted more like cake than tres leches. I've had better at Portos and at the Kogi truck.  The service was ok, most of the time our waiter was never there..and other times we'd be calling on another waiter. They never really checked to see if were ok and it was sorta weird because the waiter never smiled or anything when he was pouring our water or bringing food. We found it kind of stand-offish..

And if you've ever had a truly great Cuban sandwich, you'd know that it's second only to an eastern Carolina pulled pork sandwich in the battle for Earl's greatest honor.  Versailles looks the part. Hell...with all these great reviews, a storied history and servers bouncing around in guayaberas, KC was hyped to sink his fangs into glory. The Cuban at Versailles set KC back ten bucks which was especially lame because ya gotta drop an addition dollar for cheese which is plain silly. Everybody knows a Cuban features roasted pork, ham, pickles, mustard and swiss cheese. Without the swiss, this thing was just a Haitian.  Took the Cuban to-go since KC likes to eat in the convertible. Paying the server was a bit of an adventure since he skipped the whole cash register formality and just made change out of his wallet. Interesting move.  Back at the car, KC flipped open the Styrofoam container to reveal....french fries and no Cuban bread. Damn. This was gonna be an uphill battle. While they didn't make the fatal error of a baguette, the french bread just isn't cool. And what's up with no plantains? Weird. Anywho...check the photo.  http://www.yelp.com/bi...   Normally, KC would give a performance such as this one star. Check out this photo to see what this thing looked like under the hood.  http://www.yelp.com/bi...  Not good. Fortunately, this Yelper was starving and in desperate need of a break from his Asian diet so Versailles gets a second star. KC actually ate the whole thing...even the Styrofoam container (it needed salt).  A connoisseur of Cuban sandwiches from my time in Cuba and the eastern seaboard of the U.S., KC will now let you in on L.A.'s best Cuban sandwiches.   1.) Tropi-Cuba in Torrance 2.)

It's tasty when you mix it with black beans.  Dinner 2: Chicken #6 - It's a garlic fried chicken... another half a raw onion on top* Nothing special.. some sweet tasting sauce going on there.   This is a good change of pace from my usual Thai food and udon noodles routine. I felt like I need to go back for the Paella on another day because it needs 45 mins advance ordering.

Plenty of food, big portions. I will definitely be ordering the garlic chicken next time based on how much I saw it being ordered at the tables around me and reviews on here. I had a mojito and he had a sangria--we both liked the mojito a little better, about $4 for each. Good prices too---looking at the lunch menu prices----would be a steal considering the quality and if portions are similar size. Our waiter was in a hurry and talked to us in Spanish the whole time even though we are not Spanish-speakers, but our Spanglish seemed to work just fine.

Truth be told, there is only one thing on their menu that has kept me coming back...  While the chicken, pork, and seafood entrees I've ordered at Versailles over the years have been too often overcooked, dry, or bland to put into my regular rotation, the slow braised tender goodness that is the Versailles Oxtail Stew consistently hits the spot.  Their garlic bread, rice, black beans, and plantains are worthy accompaniments and when paired with one of their tamales, the Oxtail Stew is easily a two meal proposition.  However, I have been known to conquer the Oxtail Stew in one sitting if I can keep my hands off the garlic bread.

Since it was lunch time and they offered lunch specials I decided to go with the shredded beef (only until after I ordered did I realize they boosted the price-- they meal was listed on the table's lunch menu as $8.99, but then they have a different hanging sign saying it's actually $9.99, plus another $1 if you want plantains instead of french fries).  Anyways, the meal came out and it looked like someone threw up on the plate. \u00a0The flavor was okay, but the portion of meat was actually very small (quite contrary to what everyone else was saying about portion sizes). \u00a0My fiance got the chicken version of the Cuban sandwich, which had 0 personality and 0 flavor (they didn't season it AT ALL). Our server also had 0 personality and the food took awhile to come out. \u00a0  The beans, rice, and plantains were decent-- but the plantains reminded me of fast-food plantains like the kind you'd find at Pollo Tropical. \u00a0And black beans and rice just aren't that difficult to make.

It's the reliable neighborhood place for Cuban-style garlic chicken. I like the homey-style of this restaurant, where the walls are lined with photo art from Habana. The pictures were lovingly taken by Raymond, one of the family offspring, who was there graciously explaining each item that we tasted. I had the good fortune to dine there twice in the last couple of months for tastings of many of the dishes I have neglected in favor of my usual order of garlic roast chicken. There is much more to Versailles' menu than I knew about. Number one is: Cubans have their way with pork. Take, for example, their pork tamale. It looks rather ordinary until you notice it's served with their house citrus (mojo) sauce. It brings out the flavors in the masa. I loved it! I've returned after my first visit and purchased a bottle of the sauce to serve on roast pork at home. Delicious! I also favor the masitas de Puerco, a crisp chunk of marinated pork, flash fried. This reminds me of Filipino crispy pata or Mexican carnitas. You have to be a pork fan to love this stuff - and I am. Lechado Asada is a roasted shredded pork dish topped with thinly sliced onion and, yeah, mojo sauce.  I also learned that Cubanos hanker for vivid flavors over hot and spicy ones. Case in point is the Rabo Encendido which was a particular favorite of almost all the folks at our table. This is worthy of going back for. It's oxtail, simmered for hours in Cuban spices, bell peppers and a hint of tomato. It's featured on the plate with just a little sauce and the customary rice and black beans. It is so tangy and tender that you want to pick it up with your fingers and slurp up all that meaty goodness from the juicy nooks and crannies. Okay so, - me and my uncouth friends did just that! When I go back I will order it up with plantains on the side along with white rice and black beans. They also offer moro on the side which is a mixture of those two dishes. I love their thick, but soupy, black beans too much to mix them up with anything else. Next time I go back I will also probably share the fried red snapper. At first glance this dish appeared too crispy. It looked dry, but when I bit into it there was a definite succulence that gave a good texture to what would otherwise be a boring dish. Did I say it's so good with the house sauce? Their paella is a little different from the one I've enjoyed in Spain and Portugal. Cubans serve a saucier version with hints of bell pepper, tomato, shrimp, chicken and chorizo. I like their version, it's zesty and not dry. My favorite dessert is the guayaba with cream cheese, but most folks love the flan.  So I am definitely planning on going back. The prices are good. Garlic chicken is only 10.95 for \u00a01/2 a bird. Rabo is $14.95 Most dishes are between $10 and $15 and Paella is $22. I notice a brisk take-out business going on. Considering the ample portion sizes, I can see a family sharing a good meal for not too much $$.

The past few trips, your service has gotten worse and ever since you are now touting that new Bottled Sauce your food quality has gone down too. Your garlic sauce doesn't taste the same, it tastes like the bottle stuff you are selling which you claim is the same sauce, but trust me it tastes different.  I come to expect not the best service, but some of your staff is just not attentive at all and pretty rude as they are trying to turn over as many tables as possible.

So you can imagine my experience at Versailles. \u00a0First of all, I don't think I had ever waited so long in a line to eat - maybe to watch Batman or E.T., but for food? So I get in and order the chicken plate. \u00a0First thing that catches my attention were the bananas. \u00a0What! Cooked bananas? They were so delicious - starchy, not too sweet with a great roasted flavor. \u00a0I tried to recreate this in my kitchen and failed miserably. \u00a0Little did I know at the time that they were not bananas but plaintains - duh.  The accompanying white rice and black beans were a bit surprising also. \u00a0This is because I didn't know that anyone other than Asian people ate white rice. \u00a0Thank God that they didn't have soy sauce. \u00a0Just the thought of seeing another person eating white rice with just soy sauce would have made me go crazy - the first time I saw this was at dorms in college.  Finally the garlic chicken. Hol-y hell. \u00a0Who the hell puts so much garlic in their food? And what's with the sourness. \u00a0This dish would have been more appropriately named Lemonhead chicken. \u00a0But I couldn't stop eating. \u00a0I came back week after week, each time trying something different. \u00a0I was fascinated and intrigued by all the exotic flavors - almost like \"reading\" my first Playboy at age 7. I couldn't put it down.  Now I find myself still regularly eating there but not as often since I have moved out of the WLA area. \u00a0I still see some of the same guys waiting tables there. The mojo sauce is the best I have ever had including any I have tried in Miami. \u00a0The dishes I always fall back on are the mojo marinated pork and occasionally the oxtails. \u00a0If you have not had oxtails, you are missing out. \u00a0Tender beef in a tomato based sauce that just falls off the bone. \u00a0A bit challenging to eat but so worth it. \u00a0Unfortunately, I have never had the patience to wait for their paella. \u00a0And if you are a coconut fan, you must try their coconut shake. \u00a0So much shredded coconut, your straw will beg for forgiveness from getting clogged constantly.

Every table I saw get this item did not finish, so unless you're a fattie and have a big appetite, I suggest sharing this item with someone! This garlic chicken smelled soooooooooooo good and tasted just as great! The garlic was not too overpowering and the juices from the chicken was just so yummy. The chicken was very tender and juicy, no complaints!   Rice/Black Beans (Comes as side dish): Rice was moist and the beans were just right! Not too dry like the ones at Cafe Habana Malibu, which sucks by the way if you've tried the one in NYC, so don't go there. I am still bitter about that place. Back to the rice and beans, it was bomb!  CONCLUSION: If you love cuban food as much as I do, this place is great and the service was very friendly!

So, the order was ultimately Bistec Empanizado (breaded sirloin steak) for me, and shredded pork for the wife. I will say, the sides of fried plantains and moro were delicious, and I'd definitely recommend them. Unfortunately, my steak was pretty uninspiring - not well seasoned, not a lot of flavor. The wife's shredded pork definitely had a lot of flavor to be fair, but I don't know - maybe I'm used to Mexican, but I need my shredded meat to have some kind of accompanying edible holder, such as a tortilla or bread. The shredded pork was actually best as leftovers for makeshift Cuban sandwiches at home.

I want to like this place, I really do but this was my second visit here and I don't feel particularly compelled to come again. The service is average and the food is average, but it's not too far away and works decently as a basic sit down restaurant that doesn't take too long.   A friend and I came here for a Saturday night dinner because she was interested in trying a little Cuban food. While yelp here says they take reservations and I've made reservations here before, I was told that is not the case when I called in to make one. \u00a0Perhaps they've since changed their reservation policy or specifically do not make reservations on Saturday nights, but I'm still confused. Regardless, since they weren't taking reservations, we basically stood in a line outside the door and waited about 10 minutes. I find it strange that they didn't take people in based on their group size but instead, strictly on the order of the line. If you were at the front of the line, then you got a table next regardless of whether you had 2 people or 10 people in your group.   Once in, the food was pretty quick. We were started with some basic bread that comes drenched in butter (I'm not really into over buttering my bread; I felt that all the butter made the otherwise hard bread too greasy, \u00a0but to each his own I suppose). I then ordered the Lechon Asado, aka Cuban style pulled pork. Versailles gets an A for portion size; For $12 you get a huge scoop of rice, a sizeable plop of pulled pork slathered in onions, some plaintains, and a cup of black bean soup. I consider myself an average eater and was only able to finish about half the plate (saved the other half for another meal!). However, the food itself was pretty average. The garlic sauce they use to marinate the pork is too sour. While it's a great flavor burst for the first few bites, the sauce soon becomes a bit overwhelming. They must give you all those onions and rice to balance out the sourness, but then you end up filling up mostly on the sides and less on the main course. Further, the mild tartness of the plaintains actually hurt my tongue because my taste buds were so overwhelmed by the pork marinade.   I also had a bit of my friend's garlic chicken since many reviews seem to rave about it. I was disappointed to also find this quite average in taste. While the meat had a nice moist and soft texture, I didn't find the flavor particularly garlicky or generally notable.   Overall, the service here is fine. The waiter was extremely friendly, almost to the point of creepy, but everything was quite quick and accommodating.

They're very consistent w/ their food and service.  +1 First of all, you walk in and about 8 servers with thick mustaches are standing there ready to help you. You feel like royalty! Once you put your food orders in, the food comes out fairly quickly, within 10-15 minutes I would say.  +1 For the food! Almost everything comes in large portions with plantains and beans, rice, or morro (rice and beans mixed together). Most of their signature dishes are in a garlic mojo criollo sauce unlike any garlic sauce I've ever tasted! Their Halibut al Ajillo, Famoso Pollo Versailles and Lechon Asado are all cooked in this sauce and they're all a must-try!  Their Famoso Pollo Versailles is almost half the size of a whole rotisserie chicken, served with the garlic sauce and perfectly slow-cooked to the point where you can easily rip off the meat and taste the locked-in, juicy flavor. (I would skip the pickled onions from this dish... but that's just me! I'd prefer grilled, but I can see how the acidic taste complements their garlic sauce.)   Their Carne con Papas is also slow-cooked, tender and juicy bites of heaven!   +1 For their Sangria. When sangria comes out and the server refills it with the fruit still fermenting inside, *ohhhhhmg* you know it's gotta be good.  +1 Tres leches! They also serve this dessert as an alternative slice of birthday cake and it's delicious. You SHOULD leave room for this dessert, despite their large portions. I also love how ALL the servers participate in the birthday song by turning off all the lights and singing in a deep baritone \"Happy birthday dear, panchita/panchito,\" it's so playful and cute.  -1 Parking/Location sucks, but get past it and I will promise you that it's worth it."}, {"date": "2011-08-30", "rating": 1, "comment": "So bad for you!!"}, {"date": "2010-09-24", "rating": 4, "comment": "Get there early and order the scallops before they're sold out.

I had the chicken and pork combo plate. The portions were small considering the price and this economy. I was not crazy about the lake of sour butter sauce the food was sitting in. The chicken was good and so was the rice. The pork was just ok. The raw rings of onion teetering on top of the food was awkward and kept toppling onto the table... Ewww! We also ordered the beef empanadas, they were just okay as well. I've had much YUM empanadas elsewhere. They give a basket of bread before the meal arrives.

White rice and seasoned black beans with plantains come on the side.

During our last visit, he was horrified to find that some tables were topped with Tapatio and that one patron was drowning his food in it. Not only was that appalling to him, it also indicated that something was wrong with the flavors because when the food's right, you shouldn't need condiments.

First off we ordered the famous garlic chicken. \u00a0 Didn't you know any chicken dish that has \"famous\" in it is a must have right?! \u00a0Mind you I'm a sucker for sayings like... \"the best in town, number 1 in the city,\" and I have been bamboozled many times. \u00a0Gah!!! \u00a0Dam you NYC for advertising the best cheesecake at every corner store! \u00a0  The chicken was served with fried plantains which would have been good if their sweetness wasn't soaking in the lemony garlic sauce from the chicken, a side of black beans, and white rice. \u00a0I mean... the chicken wasn't bad... \u00a0It was on the side of OK/good, it had a crispy tasty skin and all, but it just didn't taste like anything special. \u00a0The black beans were black beans.... I definitely had better Cuban style black beans elsewhere.  As for the Rib Eye Lomo Salteado in a tomato sauce... \u00a0same thang... it was aiight.... \u00a0not bad.... just not up to the level of bombness I was expecting. \u00a0This dish was also served with the a side of rice and black beans, but the meat was kinda tough, and like the chicken the plantains picked up a lot of the tomato sauce from the beef. \u00a0One thing I did like from this dish is that there were french fries soaking in the sauce, and you can never go wrong with meat and potatoes!  The glass of sangria was definitely watered down and lacked a lot of flavor but! that Dos Equis was just right... \u00a0Granted it came nice and cold out the bottle, but how can \"the most interesting man in the world\" steer you wrong? \u00a0Did you know he once visited a psychic, just to warn her? \u00a0pshhhh.... \u00a0what a G.  I know there's a lotta Versailles lovers out there, and I probably should try more dishes to make my mark since it's so beloved. \u00a0The staff was fast to serve, but it was so busy whenever I wanted anything else I had to holler one down. \u00a0It was a madhouse in there! \u00a0As for now 2.5 stars is where I stand cuz there's better Cuban in LA.

It was too buttery for my taste, but it wasn't bad at all. My big mistake was eating too much of the bread -- don't do it! More food is coming up!  I ordered their famous Versailles chicken. They said it was half a chicken and they mean it. The portion was huge and it was roughly 10 dollars! Great price! The chicken was very juicy (HAPPY!) and had a very interesting flavor - I loved it. It came with a side of plantains. I normally don't like cooked plantains but they made it delicious. It also comes with a side of black beans and rice (or you can mix it together - moro). The beans and rice are also very good.  Because I was so pleased, I took my boyfriend here. He can eat a lot, but he'll only eat a lot if he likes it. He loved it here. I recommended the chicken to him and I ordered the pork. We were both pleased with our orders. The chicken was filling because of the huge portions and the pork was delicious. I love the added lemony taste they add to their food. He was happy and I was happy.  Parking is unpredictable, you may or may not get a spot.

He pretended to be deaf to my protests, and soon enough, hunger won out over fears of being mugged on the cold streets of LA. \u00a0We crossed Venice, stepped into Versailles, and I let out a sigh of relief. \u00a0We made it in one piece.  The restaurant itself brought comfort, too. \u00a0After all, it was brightly lit, surprisingly spacious, and bustling with customers. \u00a0We were seated quickly, a two-top towards the back of the room. \u00a0The decor wasn't all that special, but it was homey enough.  We were given our massive menus and left alone to peruse them at peace. \u00a0I opened it up and...  It's an indecisive person's WORST NIGHTMARE. \u00a0No joke, there are probably over a hundred menu items listed. \u00a0It took me at least ten minutes to get through the menu because I kept forgetting what I'd seen on previous pages.

Anyway, MY DISH was not... pleasing to my taste buds.  The chicken was fine, nice and juicy and all, but... the sauce had to go home. \u00a0It was overly citrusy, to the point where it tasted like a sort of lemon vinaigrette salad dressing. \u00a0Pretty much, I thought it was way too sour (I could literally feel my taste buds puckering with each bite).  I didn't want the food to go to waste, so I had to do what I could to salvage it. \u00a0I asked for some hot sauce. \u00a0After slathering my chicken with Tapatio, it became more palatable.  Really, it wasn't the food itself. \u00a0It was the sauce. \u00a0I'm not keen AT ALL on that sauce. \u00a0I kept mentioning how it tasted like sour salad dressing...  And sure enough...  On our way out...  I saw bottles of \"sauce\" on the counter by the cashier. \u00a0It was some sort of Cuban lemon sauce... \"perfect for beef, chicken, pork, seafood, and salad!\" \u00a0OMG it WAS salad dressing!!! \u00a0How can ONE sauce compliment pretty much EVERYTHING?!  Maybe it's a Cuban thing and my tongue is just too uncultured to appreciate it all.  Whatever the case, I've decided that this Cuban lemon sauce is totally not my thing.

You don't go to Versailles not knowing what to expect or because you are out for an evening full of surprises, you go because you know exactly what you're going to get: \u00a0good, salty, heartburn-inducing food, sort of tacky ambiance and service that is hardly ever better than \"meh.\" But, it's Versailles, so it's perfectly fine.  Everybody knows by now that the dish to get is the #6, the garlic chicken with onions. In the past though, I have had good luck with the pork chops and the squid ink rice--which Jonathan Gold once described very accurately as the color of asphalt ... yummy, delicious asphalt.   Last night, friend and I decided to go the cheap route and get one order of the chicken and one vegetarian plate--of rice, beans and plantains, and then just split the chicken. It was a good idea, too, because we both had enough to take home as leftovers.   Side note: \u00a0their \"vegetarian\" menu is pretty funny. It's comprised of two items: \u00a0the aforementioned plate of rice, beans and plantains, and another plate that offers the rice and beans served TOGETHER, plantains, and a green salad. Here's a tip--if you have vegetarian/vegan friends, DO NOT take them to Versailles. Looking at that menu reminded me of the scene in Everything Is Illuminated, when Elijah Wood's character explains that he's a vegetarian, and the others react aghast and ask, \"NO MEAT?\" Yeah, those two paltry veggie options is Versailles' way of asking NO MEAT?

The ambiance was dim but noisy, and unlike many places that have been hit hard by the economy, the crowd has yet to abandon their craving for a good hearty Cuban meal.  What I have quickly realized was the noticeable price increase while my dish failed to live up to its reputation. My garlic chicken had mixed results as the juicy dark meat was tender and delicious but the other half of the chicken was terribly dry and tough. The side of black beans was still a great addition to go on top of the rice, and the generous serving of plantanos continued to be one of my all time favorites. I was encouraged to see that they now have paella on the menu, but at the price of $19.95 the dish is a bit out of reach for me.  The server did not return to refill our water and the noise level was so high that my friends and I had a difficult time hearing each other during the entire meal. I figured to be back at some point since I'm not ready to give up on their other dishes, but my expectations will certainly be more guarded with the hope that they will help me to rediscover the very reasons for liking this place in the beginning.

If you're looking for high-class service, you won't find it here, but our server was as pleasant as he could have been while trying to flip his tables as quickly as possible.   Our 4 person table ended up ordering: 3 garlic porks (me included) and 1 oxtail (the BF's dish). The food arrived quickly and then it was chow time. Not usually a fan of plantains, I announced quietly to my bf, \"you can have these later.\" I mixed in my beans with the rice and got working on the shredded pork. It was very garlicky, but at least I won't have the only garlic-breath at the table. The flavors were simple but all there. I even started to eat the plantains (the sweetness offset the salty flavor of the rest of the meal), and had only one left for the BF by the time I finished.  For a first time visit, I thought the pork was a good choice. I had a few bites of the oxtail, and I felt that was a bit more flavorful. The menu seems to have so much more to offer than just their garlic signature. When I return, I'll definitely want to change it up.

I'm a fan and I like the food better than A-OK but it doesn't elicit a 'Yay!'  I prefer this location to the one on La Cienega Blvd because the parking is more convenient here. Whenever I've tried anything but the roasted pork, I've regretted not ordering the garlic roast pork, so now I just stick with that. My rating is based solely on that dish. The other meat dishes, including the chicken, can be dry and bland. Most of the flavor comes from the garlic mojo sauce, which could use more garlic. But with all the rice, beans, and fried plantains you get, it really hits the spot. Unfortunately, this place used to be known for being cheap and filling.

Well, I grew up eating at this hole in the wall, amazing, friendly restaurant. For as long as I can remember, my parents would take me and my little sisters here every time we step foot in California.  Since I was a kid, my order stayed the same whenever I go to Versailles. Chilindron de Cordero - Cured sauteed lamb, simmered in tomato, herbs/spices and wine sauce. And after having bites from friends' and family's dishes, the lamb is my favorite. Never have I ever had lamb so tender, to the point where if you press your fork slightly onto it, it falls apart. Why settle for the typical beef and chicken? Live a little and try the lamb, if you haven't already. You'll fall in love. The wine sauce that it's swimming in is rich and flavorful. The rice is by far my favorite rice I've ever eaten. And I eat rice everyday. I don't know what they do to that rice, but its damn good, even alone. Slightly sweet and buttery, in my opinion.  The plantains, the sweet \u00a0fried plantains. Without them no dish at Versailles would be complete. Mildly sweet, creamy and a little crispy all at the same time. Then comes the black beans in its own little bowl. I'm not a fan of beans, but I will be for these black beans. Most people mix the beans into their rice but, I prefer to eat everything separate, so I can enjoy each item on my plate individually.   I know the combination of meat, plantains and black beans sound like an odd mix, but don't knock till you've tried it. I brought my picky/hard to please boyfriend here and he loved it. He ordered the Ropa Vieja but, couldn't keep his fork away from my plate. If you're scared to try new places, come here. You won't be disappointed. I promise. Whatever you order, make sure you ask for extra onions on the side! Yes, they're raw. But don't be frightened, they have this to die for vinegary taste to them and it works really well with the rice and meat.  Service for me is always perfect. Friendly, fast and helpful. The parking however, scares the crap out of me. If you're claustrophobic, you might want someone who isn't park the car. It gets a little crowded. Other than that, I have no complaints.   *Versailles will please even the pickiest tongue."}, {"date": "2007-11-14", "rating": 5, "comment": "Wow, I really loved this place!.. so much in fact that a few days later I tried the one on La Cienga in LA. \u00a0  I went with a group of friends and would have left (because of the line out front) had we not had to wait for a last friend to arrive before revising plans. \u00a0By the time the friend arrived, we realized the line was moving pretty quickly and decided to stay. \u00a0I'm so glad we did. \u00a0I've eaten at other Cuban restaurants before, in San Jose and Las Vegas, but never cared much for the food...

The sauce came across as kind of tangy...in an overpowering way. \u00a0I'm ok with strong flavors and garlic, but this didn't jive with me the right way. \u00a0The chicken and onions seemed cooked well enough, but it just didn't impress like I had hoped it would. \u00a0And for the price (not unreasonable, but not dirt cheap) I was hoping to be happy. \u00a0My wife agreed with my sentiments.  The second time we went, I went for the Paella. \u00a0I remembered from the first time we had gone that we would have to allow for 30 to 45 minutes to prepare the paella, so we went with that in mind. \u00a0The notion of a big helping of steamed seafood with sauce and rice sounded great. \u00a0The price for this dish was pretty significant (I believe it's for a party two people to split) so I had high expectations for the delivery of this as well.  It came out in a timely manner and looked good, but I recall that there were lots of shells on the shellfish still (like the crab and shrimp) which made the dish challenging to eat. \u00a0It also didn't have any...pizazz (for lack of a better term) to really get me excited and happy about the choice I had made. \u00a0Again, my wife shared my sentiments. \u00a0I think I'd be willing to go one more time since there is so much positive feedback for the restaurant, but I have a feeling that Cuban food done the \"Versailles way\" is just not for me. \u00a0Sad, too.

Okay- My initial reason for going to Versailles was because of all the good comments they have gotten. Everyone talked of how the food was so good and plentiful. For some reason they did not mention how loud, smoky, and obnoxious the atmosphere is. Maybe they are used to this sort of thing.  I decided to have dinner here on a Saturday night. From the entrance the place seemed quiet and pleasant. That bubble quickly burst once I entered and was seated.  The place was smokey with a burnt, greasy odor in the air, like when you \u00a0leave something on the stove and it begins to scorch. What's more, I was really taken aback by how LOUD and OBNOXIOUS the other patrons were. They were all being boisterous and trying to talk at once. After awhile I realised that many of them had gotten liquored up before going there for dinner.  The food was okay. I ordered the #6 : It was their signature chicken with rice and black beans. I got an entire plate of rice and a TEACUP of black beans, which is disproportionate in my opinion. The chicken was good with it's warm and flavorful sauce. However, it is not something I could'nt make. [ The #6 is described as half a chicken. For some reason customers gush about how they got \"like half a chicken, dude\". Again, the menu says just that. Surprise!!]   The bread (sourdough?) was decent. They do not have fountain drinks. Only canned sodas which you have to purchase individually.  Out of about 200+ reviews only one other person said she felt uncomfortable sitting among people who talked loud and stared. I must say, If you are loud, obnoxious, and have no class you will fit right-in here. I'm guessing that weekdays during lunch may be a little quieter than weekends and eves.

Neither of us had tried Cuban food before, and I was pretty excited to try something new. There's a huge colorful sign that says \"Cuban Food\" right out front, so it's hard to miss this place.   *Roasted pork ($7.99): awesome! Reminded me of carnitas. If you like the combination of lemon, vinegar, and garlic, you'll enjoy the pork a lot. This dish also came with lots of onions, plantains, black beans, and rice.The plantains were fried, and had a nice sweet taste to it. The black beans tasted pretty good, though I'm usually not a huge fan of beans.  *Roasted chicken ($7.99): I tried a bit of my friend's order, and it tasted pretty good. It seems like they pretty much give you half a chicken, so if you're really hungry, this is a good option. It's also marinated in the same sauce as the pork. This also comes with plantains, rice, and black beans.   *Materva ($2.99): Cuban apple soda. It's pretty good, and it's sweetened with cane sugar.   *Ironbeer ($2.99): beer fortified with iron supplements..... \u00a0I wish. It basically tastes like a sarsaparilla/tropical root beer.   Overall, the food here is pretty good and the service isn't bad. The restaurant is spacious enough, but it gets packed fast.

Tons of rice, beans and plantains. My other 2 favorites include fried breaded pork chops and red whole red snapper.   Since moving away from this hood, we never had time to revisit. Yesterday we did.   First off, yes, you can still feel the presence of grad students hanging there.   Second, Versaille remodeled the interior! Gone are the fugly curtains! Hooray!   Third, prices went up by $2. Garlic chicken now $10.95, pork chop $12.95 etc. And of course smaller portion of rice + beans etc.   The 1-star isn't so much because of the last bullet point. Ok, so rising operational costs means we have to fork out a little more. That's fine. But that doesn't mean the quality of the food has to go down. That's my problem with restaurants these days. They take the opportunity to increase the profit margin in both directions.  The chicken tasted blend and the garlic sauce ain't that garlicky anymore. I recalled that the fried chicken skin literally melted in my mouth. They don't anymore. And how difficult is it to fry breaded pork chops? I have done it at home and the texture always come out just right. Apparently very challenging for Versaille. The chops were tough (overcooked) and the breaded skins fell off even before entering my mouth. I was eating chops and breaded flakes separately. Perhaps Versaille should take a lesson from the Japanese how they did their Katsu Chops.  Just one more point if any one don't know this yet. Yes the chicken are pre-fried and placed under a heat lamp. So there you are eating KFC-operational style food. Plus when Versaille does it, it's somehow still approved as an \u00a0\"A\" restaurant.

I ordered their famous 1/2 garlic chicken with white rice, black beans and tostones instead of maduros. \u00a0For those unfamiliar with plantains, tostones are from the green plantain and the maduros are yellow and sweeter. \u00a0Starting with the chicken, I wasn't crazy about it. \u00a0The skin had a nice crunch but the vinegar citrus marinade sauce was too overwhelming. \u00a0That seems to be my issue with Cuban food. \u00a0They use too much vinegar and citrus in their meats. \u00a0The white rice was fine but the beans had no taste whatsoever. \u00a0The tostones were the best thing. \u00a0I may give Versailles another try one day, but I doubt it since their signature dish isn't that good. \u00a0The portion size was nice but almost $12.00? \u00a0It should be more like $8.  I hate to sound biased since I'm half Puerto Rican, but I prefer it over Cuban. \u00a0Puerto Rican is better seasoned and doesn't use so much citrus and vinegar. \u00a0The problem, there are hardly any Puerto Rican restaurants in LA. \u00a0To be fair though, I haven't been to many Cuban restaurants in this town. \u00a0I'm open to suggestions. \u00a0So far the best tasting I've had is Havana Mania in Redondo Beach. \u00a0Everything there is so flavorful!"}, {"date": "2010-08-04", "rating": 4, "comment": "This place is a favorite of my Cuban friend.

I had vegetable tom yum which tasted nothing like tom yum soup I had at any other Thai restaurant. Basically it was spicy broth with some carrots, which is not really tom yum.

Tucked in amidst a number of high-end, swanky restaurants (replete with, of course, sofas outside) is Bangkok One. Of my time in DC, perhaps the strangest restaurant experience I've had.  First of all, the smell of the restaurant is very strange. It smells like a mixture of pineapple and sewage. Did not smell good at all.  Second, the service was prompt, though this could be explained by the fact that my girlfriend and I were the only people in the restaurant at 6:30 on a Friday.   Third, the appetizer, the Vegetable rolls, tasted like they could have come out of a freezer at your local Giant. The Thai iced coffee tasted about what one would expect of Thai Iced Coffee, while my gf got the Thai Iced Tea (way too sweet).  Dinner and dessert: the worst pad thai I had ever eaten...ever. Noodles seemed like a mixture of undercooked and overcooked (if possible). Though the taste was ok (more peanuty than pad thais I've had before), it still was very sub-par. Dessert, though, was bar none the WORST dessert I have had in DC. Another review had classified the ice cream as \"old and stale\"- we got a red bean ice cream and that encapsulated the ice cream perfectly.  The only reason I give this two stars: it has a coupon on  http://restaurant.com , so our meal cost significantly less than it would have.

The restaurant was very quiet compared to its neighbor DC Coast. We walked in the restaurant thinking maybe we won't get to eat there because they might be closed soon. To our delight, the very polite and timid Thai fella told us they are open till at least 11 if not midnight. Upon learning that, we flopped our butts down as he led us to our booth, passing one other couple.  Since it was so late, we didn't want to pig out like we usually would after a long day at work, so we decided to go with one appetizer and one entree to share. We ordered the Yum Mango (special of the month) as an appetizer, which was mango, onions, tomatoes, green beans in a spicy cilantro lime dressing, and drunken noodles an an entree. Of course, we asked for the dishes to be prepared Thai spicy. The Yum Mango came out really fast and it was DELICIOUS!!! The sweetness of the mango and the sourness of the lime dressing, fired up with Thai chili flakes, it was such a nice kick for your tastebuds. The drunken noodles came out 2 minutes after we finished our appetizer and it was the best drunken noodles I've had yet in the DC area. Usually when you get drunken noodles, the noodles come out swimming in a plate of oil and everything looks dark and greasy, which is precisely the reason I almost never order drunken noodles unless the craving for spicy grease creeps up on me. But the drunken noodles at Bangkok One was so different and wonderfully tasty. When the dish came out, I couldn't see the noodles. As I found out as I dug my chopsticks in, the noodles were covered by a yummy thick layer of stir-fried chicken (or beef or pork depends on what you order), and the noodles seemed and tasted like they were just boiled real quick instead of stir-fried. So they boiled the noodles, put them on the plate and then poured the chicken and the sauce over it. Since chicken doesn't absorb much grease and the noodles are boiled, the dish was light yet tasty.   I was so content after my appetizer and entree that I didn't feel the need to order dessert for once.

Their menu kind of surprised me but perhaps I am still a greenhorn in terms of Thai restaurants. It seemed to be bigger and had more variety than other Thai places I've been to. We ordered the chicken satay and Siam Noodles (I think thats what it was). The chicken satay was delicious. They offered more than enough of the peanut sauce which was a plus because I think thai places dont serve enough of it. The chicken itself was also very good. It was juicy and well spiced. Even without the sauce it was definitely was able to stand on its own. The Siam noodles had a lot of seafood, scallops, shrimp, clams, and possibly squid. The dish was spicy but the waiter was more than happy to provide a set of different spices to heat it up even more. The rice noodles themselves were ok, sometimes it tasted a bit \"hard\" like it had dried out or it wasn't cooked long enough. \u00a0  Dessert was lychee ice cream and sticky rice with mangoes. The ice cream came in a very retro looking sundae cup (no idea what to call it) and came with a fan shaped spoon which was also very cute. It was fun eating with it, and by that I don't mean it was difficult, it was just fun. The ice cream was creamy and smooth but at times I could sworn I felt grains (ice).

BUT it was cold, we were hungry, and there was very little else open in the North End at almost noon on a Sunday, so in we came. As we were entering, an older gentleman standing outside assured us that we had made a good choice, and that we'd have \"the best cappuccino in town\", which was very cute. Apparently he's a die-hard regular, which is cool in my book.   We seated ourselves in one of the few open tables, (which turned out to be horribly wobbly, so we ended up moving as soon as another table was clean), and looked over the somewhat limited brunch menu. I quickly decided on the lobster croissant (I'm guessing this is Caffe Graffiti's version of the lobster roll), and my husband opted for a general 2 eggs breakfast with a couple of sides.   I do have to say that service was surly at best. When our server finally came over to our table, she simply stared at us until we stuttered uncomfortably through our orders, then she picked up the menus and left. I don't believe she actually uttered any words, and forget about a smile.   However, the cappuccinos were good, my husband enjoyed his breakfast, and my lobster croissant was pretty freaking good (there was fresh basil on it, which was a nice touch), so I'm still going to give 3 stars, even with crappy service. I will forgive a lot if there's good lobster involved. Plus, the owner (?) or someone did come to our table to see how we liked our meal.   The area where we sat had plenty of windows overlooking Boston, exposed brick walls, granite topped tables and wood floors. It was cozy, inviting, and let in plenty of winter light, which was nice.

Great dinner for two  Hit up this North End re-invention on a Friday night, and found it to seemingly be in the midst of an identity crisis. It's not a typical cafe with pastry and coffee, not quite a bar with tv's and appetizers, and not entirely a restaurant. I'd definitely head back here again, provided I could sit in the more intimate back area away from the bar, metal tables and bright lights.  The restaurant personality of Caffe Graffiti is quite nice, encompassing about 10 tables in a darker back area presided over by a wall-sized arched brick window overlooking the street. The food is typical, pasta chicken and seafood in mammoth portions for under $17.  The calamari appetizer is tasty, crispy without a hint of sogginess. I could do without the vegetables mixed in though, because if I wanted vegetable tempura I would have ordered that. It's kind of hard to tell sometimes if it's a cauliflower of small piece of calamari.  I had the Rigatoni Boscaiola, which was perfectly cooked, but a bit too saucy for my liking. Of course, I foolishly finished the whole thing and slipped into a food coma, unable to even get in a second glass of wine.  Despite a lack of room for more wine, when in a Caffe that neglects to serve coffee, instead opting only for espresso beverages, one must see what's up. The espresso shot was sweet with only a touch of bitterness, and sugar wasn't really necessary. I love that it's served in the traditional way, without even a hint of an offer for cream.  It's strange, because its seems that despite being on the visible front of the North End, we had no problem finding a seat on a Friday night at 8. They take reservations, but if you're shut out of other places in the area, you'll most likely find perch here.

We had eaten a late lunch that day, so we planning to maybe split an app, have dessert and maybe a drink or two. I told the hostess this, but when the waiter realized he seemed a little miffed that we were not ordering dinner. He actually seemed grouchy the whole time.

I think they waved the St. Germain over it. We decided to order the fried calamari to which our waiter proclaimed \"good choice, no one else makes it like us.\" Well, he was right, but not in a good way...we were served what appeared to be a large portion of fried calamari but upon closer examination you could see that they \"fill\" the order with fried vegetables (Cauliflower, carrots, peppers, etc). I would not have minded the addition of the vegetables but for the fact they were drenched in lemon and salt making them unpleasant to eat.   Throughout our time there, I mentioned to the waiter that we wanted dessert. However, he never asked us if we wanted it and after ordering a second round of drinks (cordial of Sambuca and a SoCo Sour) he brought us the check. I had to remind him we wanted to dessert.   At that point we should have just left, but the Baccio Gelato was calling my name, so we had some. That was all that looked appealing to me in the case (they do not have a dessert menu).

I like Pizza Hut for their deals which always include specialty pizzas like veggie and meat ones (works well for my bf and I). At this location, there's online ordering and delivery which never got our order wrong, were timely, and the pizza was always hot. When we walked to pick up our pizzas, they offered us free slices of a new pizza which is always good. My bf liked this location because of the wingstreet and liked the wings with no complaints. I like their cheesebread which is a good mix of cheese and bread, not too heavy on the bread or cheese. It's a good branch of a chain."}], "id": "7733768858"}

I guess you can say that you only find real Dominican food at home, but I have tried places in NYC that manage to get a lot closer to the authentic taste of Latin cuisine.   Now, If you have never tried authentic Latin food, then most likely you will love them. They do have lovely way to present food and their portions are very big! Their prices are pretty cheap and the staff is always lovely. The decor is very nice and I love when they have live music. The Pina colada is very good and so is the Mojito.   I give it a 3 because I know it is not the best Dominican food out there but they are doing a hell of a job keeping the place running.

The appetizer platter is great to share and it comes with pan fried meats (steak, chicken, pork), yucca, and platinos. It's accompanied by a garlic dipping sauce.

Their main focus is their call-in orders, don't walk in hungry and think you're going to be served in less than an hour. I waited two hours on one of their slow afternoons and they still forgot my food- my entire table of 6 people was done eating and I still had nothing and I had ordered the same plate some else at my table had ordered and she had her food but not me. I had to actually ask the server where my food was &amp; all she could say was, 'It's the kitchen's fault;' yet I'm seeing other tables getting served who showed up after us. I had to cancel my order because who knows what would've come out of that kitchen.  On top of everything they add their own 18% tip to the final balance!

Here's what I loved about the place:  - gorgeous, warm, friendly, vibrant decor that transports you to somewhere tropical and makes you forget the sketchy neighborhood you just passed through to get here  - super-friendly waitress who patiently answered our millions of qs  - ridonkulously huge portions of so much food our spacious table for 6 literally could not hold any more plates before our sides had finished arriving  - amazing prices for the ridonkulously huge portions of food  Here's what didn't thrill me: The food itself really wasn't that amazing.  Our group got the Picadera Merengue (sampler platter with fried meats, green plantains and yucca fries) and Queso Frito (fried cheese) to start our meal. The fried cheese was tasty (how can you go wrong with fried cheese?) but the various meats were over-grilled to the point of being dry and stiff. The plantains were nicely done but the yuvva fries could have been moister (having backpacked through Peru, I know this is possible without sauce).  For entrees, I got the Almejas (mussels), opting for Creole sauce for an authentic dish. The mussels were pretty fresh but the sauce was about 1 degree too salty. Good a first, then you realize you're chugging water like a sorority girl just to make it through the next bite. On the flip side, the Spanish rice with beans that came as my side was completely dry and tasteless. (I did combine the two when I took the rest of the dish home for leftovers and voila, problem solved!)  Other dishes I tried included the Filete de Chillo al Gusto (red snapper filet) in both coconut and Creole sauce, and both were very well done (meat nice and tender). The Chuletas de Cerdo Frita (center cut fried pork chops) were too dry and tough. The chicken mofongo came in a huge pyramid of ridiculous quantity but it was a bit too dry and tasteless for me.  So overall, while I enjoyed trying out a cuisine I don't often get to have, the food itself didn't seem very well-cooked. Perhaps it is a Dominican thing to have drier meats, but I like my meat as tender as possible. Glad I came, not in a rush to come back.

Is it a 5 star restaurant? Certainly not without failings but when considering the narrow scope of Massachusetts latin restaurants-yes, this is the best ive found.   Location-Oh not the most scenic surroundings for sure. My innocent 8 yr old asked if this was a bad place. Careful with all the broken glass on your way in.   Atmosphere-Completely different world once you walk through the front door-charismatic, fun, casual and warm. A great job decorating and furnishing authentically. Wicker chairs, comfy wrap around booths, colorful walls and oil paintings. Windows, typically positively valued, are instead wisely covered with dark curtains to hide the harsh exterior world.   Food-I love Puerto Rican food. I dont want some Caribbean fusion- blasphamy!-no-i want traditional reminds me home and abuela food. While this is technically Dominican food its close enough. The best was the simplest, the garlic dipping sauce. The steak, appetizers and flan for dessert were also quite good. The rice was a bit mushy and the only glaring failing was the all important mofongo. Mofongo is actually a Puerto Rican derived dish and a staple for any restaurant the way chicken parm is for any italian establishment. You could almost judge how good the restaurant is by the quality of the mofongo. Perhaps its a dominican variant im not appreciating but it was simply not good. Dry, tasteless and hollow. The soft bacon encrusted reveals its stray from authenticity. Nonetheless i truly enjoyed my meal, so much so that my inability to stop eating, coupled with the huge portion size, made me overeat with extreme gluttony! I ate exactly once that day and surely it was enough for two weeks worth of deep fried joy.   Service-Wonderful. We were greeted warmly when we walked in. Speaking spanish is not required here but presumably it makes for a more friendly experience.   Odd-The bathroom was rather dirty which is a shame because it is beautifully tiled.

Each of us ordered a meal and some sides. Turns out, we ordered way too much food. The portions here are absolutely huge so be wary of that if you're with a small group.

The waitress was so kind and sweet. We also got plaintains and mini meat patties. Those were delish, but the the plaintains were dry.

In honor of my friend's birthday and Dominican Republic's Independence day, a group of friends and I decided to head over to this restaurant to enjoy an authentic Dominican meal.   The service was exceptional despite the busy crowd. They were very accommodating and attentive to our large group.   Although they have a fairly wide and delicious sounding selection of juices and other fruity concoctions, I decided to get an \"El Presidente\" to keep up with the theme of the night, Dominican traditions. I'm not an avid beer drinker but found the El Presidente to be crisp and refreshing. I liked how the beer was super carbonated. I thought it had a strong taste. However, my friend believes otherwise, saying that the El Presidente that you find in DR is much stronger and also comes in a larger size.   We decided to share some appetizers and decided to get the appetizer sampler of fried meats. I don't think you can ever go wrong with fried food. I found the meats to be under seasoned which I actually found to be better because the salt was right within our reach and I had control of however much I needed. I thought the empanadas was a tasty little bite and the toastones provided a nice fibery crunch.   I decided to order the chicharrones (fried chunks of chicken...as if I didn't already have my limit of fried foods). The chicken was tender and moist on the inside and super crispy on the outside. The chicken was well-seasoned this time with an interesting blend of what I assumed to be different spices and herbs. For an extra $5, you can add a side dish called \"Mofongo\" (a mashed plaintain dish- think Mashed potatoes). It was huge and truly a satisfying meal by itself. The mofongo was delicious with a surprise of either fried chicken or fried pork (your choice). The entree also came with a large portion size of white rice and beans (you can also get brown rice and beans), which was yet again another meal by itself.   The food was delicious and the atmosphere was very laid back and it felt like I was at home, enjoying a good meal with family!"}, {"date": "2008-01-21", "rating": 4, "comment": "Merengue is the best. \u00a0 Authentic delicious dominican food, high quality ingredients, fun ambience, cute service, and the prices are cheap for what you get. \u00a0The rice and beans, together or seperate, are perfect which is the basis of most Carribbean joints. \u00a0 The Merengue Steak, Monfongo (all kinds), and Batidas are crowd pleasers. \u00a0Actually, I have never heard anyone complain about a dish they ordered there, so order what you like cus it will be good. \u00a0If you love baseball, go there on a night where the Sox are playing...its so much fun. \u00a0The thing I like about it most is this is real Boston neighborhood restuarant feels like! \u00a0Folks from the neighbood and from the outside together having fun, not pretenticous despite the real nice decor. \u00a0People watching, beautiful staff, and great music all a plus. \u00a0The only this is that service can be a bit slow, but it takes a lot of love to make food this good."}, {"date": "2009-11-13", "rating": 5, "comment": "EXTRA, EXTRA: A Dominican guy wants to share his opinion about the best known Dominican restaurant in Greater Boston!

You are welcome by walls painted with an explosion of warm, vivacious colors which immediately make you feel at home, a necessary condition if you want to imitate Dominican hospitality. On the walls too, there are paintings glorifying some of the produce most represented in our cuisine. Overall, the venue has a rustic, woody feel to it that gives the restaurant an aura of authenticity.  You have beautiful and friendly waitresses very knowledgeable about the menu and who seem to believe it is their duty to bring a smile to your face. The waiting time for any given dish is low, and you would have most of any item on the menu served, except for the ever famous sancocho, which because of its high demand may be over by the time you get there.  I've had so many dishes at this place that I won't talk about anyone in particular, but just say that they are consistently cooked excellently well.

Something ethnic and delicious and not expensive. After searching all the usual websites, Abby found Merengue.  Located on Blue Hill Ave, a short 7 minute drive from our condo, we arrived to find easy street parking. (Crossing the street though wasn't as easy.) We entered in to find a bar area on the left and a dining area on the right. We get seated in a booth but are quickly asked to move to a smaller table because the entire booth was reserved. No biggie. The dining room is very colorful and there were plenty of people enjoying drinks and hanging out. This is definitely the type of place that it seems everyone there knew each other. (Sure enough, in the middle of our meal, a large group came in and the couple sitting next to us gave them all hugs and hellos and moved tables together so that they can eat together.)  The menu is big and with tons of options. Abby went with Filetillo (Steak Tips Cooked in Creole Sauce with Green Peppers, Red Peppers and Onion) and I went with Chuletas a la Jardinera (Fried Pork Chop Garden Style, Topped with Green Peppers, Red Peppers and Onion). We probably should have gotten the Mofongos, but completely forgot to order it. That was ok though because our sides (Spanish rice and white rice with beans) were plenty huge and both dishes came with a small salad too. We also ordered a drink that was very reasonably priced.  Our meals were fantastic. The pork, while a couple of bites were dry, was perfectly cooked with a nice crust. The white rice was plain, but I cut up the pork along with some of the peppers and onions and ate it all together. Very nice. The beans also were delicious. Abby's steak was in a nice tomato-y sauce and was perfectly cooked as well. I didn't think the Spanish rice was anything special, but she definitely did. Also, the portions for both were huge. This was a great dinner.  Merengue met all expectations and is a spot I'd come back to again. The service and the food was fantastic and well above average. The whole fish that our neighbor got looked amazing and I'd like to give that a try next time. The prices were also in the sweet spot, with most items around $10.

Seems crazy, considering that mediocre raw fish could have painful consequences, so I guess that makes me a risk taker. Or just too lazy to walk to a 4-star joint.  Sanraku is tucked within the Metreon building, with a nice view of Yerba Buena garden. Like most sushi joints, the ambience is nothing to marvel at - it's simple, clean, and gets the job done. So, let's talk sushi...  The menu is totally standard, with some bento box lunch specials and your run-of-the-mill rolls. I always have to have my seaweed salad, so I was lured by the special Sanraku seaweed salad, claiming to have 3 different types of seaweed on a bed of greens. For $10, I had high hopes. Yes, it came with 3 types of seaweed, but in measly little portions; the majority of this pricey salad being lettuce, not seaweed. The dressing was more acidic than flavorful, and I couldn't wait for my sushi to arrive...this salad was just not cuttin' it.   We shared a few of the fancy rolls; you know, the ones that Americans order (with spicy mayo sauce and tempura fried this and that). They were mostly delicious, and definitely filled the sushi void. Service was sporadic (who exactly was our server? We weren't sure), and during the lunch rush that became a problem when we needed to jet back to the office for a meeting. Next time we'll tell them we're on a tight schedule, maybe that'll help.  Pricey sushi, considering the location.

Everything was good except the albacore tataki. It was a little too seared for my taste, resulting in dry fish. The spicy sauce was weird and seemed more suited for a burger. Negihama was generously sized and the fish to rice ratio was great! The nigiri had a pretty presentation with long tails and were delicious.

I arrived at the tail end of happy hour (almost 7:00) and it wasn't busy but wasn't empty either.  For dinner I ordered a salmon skin roll and an Ishikari roll. The salmon skin roll was quite good, warm salmon and not chewy at all.  The Ishikari roll. Was. Amazing. I like my sushi soft, buttery, and with a mild, delicate flavor. This roll fit the bill. Avocado and imitation crab on the inside, topped with seared salmon, tobiko, green onion, and miso sauce. It was melt in your mouth good with a hint of smokiness from the seared salmon. Definitely one of the tastiest sushi rolls I've ever eaten. I will be back for more!  As I was writing this review, the waiter brought my check along with slices of pineapple and orange. Seriously?

I'll get into that in a mo) of raw fish, but in all seriousness, given San Francisco prices, Sanraku surprised the hell out of me in a really good way.  There were four places in the SOMA that made it onto our list of 'graced more than once' establishments during our stay in SF, just because they were so darn good. One was The Grove, another was Sentinel, thirdly there was Samovar and finally Sanraku. You just don't get sushi like this over the Atlantic. And about those prices, you really can get some great stuff for what seems like a bargain - particularly the combo dishes which include a selection of sushi and a main meal like salmon teriyaki alongside the ever faithful miso soup, which I must say is delicious.  The tuna just melts in the mouth, the colours are exceptional and I will take it as a personal offense if you don't order the spider roll when you're here. Trust me, it's not as scary as it sounds.

I personally ordered the Combination Lunch which come with your choice of:  4 pieces of nigiri, 5 pieces of sashimi, or 6 pieces of California Roll served with miso soup and steamed rice with chicken terriyaki.   The chef's choice of nigiri on this particular day included cuts of salmon, tuna, shrimp and yellow tail. The sushi was solid, but not pretty standard. The chicken was a little overcooked, but the flavor delicately sweet and savory and tasted delicious over the perfectly cooked rice. Additionally, there was a lush salad served adjacently topped with a light vinaigrette dressing.  Although I was not incredibly hungry to start with, I was able to polish off almost everything and yet managed not to feel bloated or weighed down after the fact. It was an incredibly filling, light lunch.  I'd definitely come back, although it would not be my first choice or a huge rec I'd throw out to someone unless they were in the neighborhood and looking for a quick fix!

I love sushi with a fiery passion and hadn't eaten it in awhile.   First, we got sorta lost looking for the place. After going up a few floors in the Metreon, then going outside, and passing the door, we found it. The door is a bit inconspicuous and doesn't quite look like the entrance to anything. And the restaurant is oddly shaped, as other Yelpers have mentioned; it's long and skinny.   As soon as we got there and greeted the group, rounds of hot sake were ordered and promptly downed. And after a few cups, I realized the BF and I hadn't eaten anything! We finished off the rest of the appetizers (gyoza and some random rolls), then we all ordered our dinners.   The BF and I shared the sashimi salad deluxe (such delicious fresh fish with a great ginger vinaigrette), the rock 'n roll (eel &amp; avocado roll, which was good, but the brown eel sauce covered up the eel), and some miso soup (decent, but not very hot). And he ordered some nigiri, which was good, even though I can't recall what fish it was.   The rest of the group ordered the dinner specials, which included teriyaki of some type (salmon, beef, etc) with rice and steamed veggies, sushi (sashimi or CA roll), and miso soup. I heard no complaints from them, and they cleaned off their plates, so I assume it was good!  And the hot sake. We managed to finished off 13 rounds of hot sake between 4 of us (2 of the girls stopped at 1 cup, which is less than half a round). And we tried some nigori (unfiltered) sake, which I prefer, and the boys have sake bombs.   Our waiter, Jin, looked a bit bored. Or lifeless, but he took care of us and our wild sake-downing mess. And I managed to crack a smile out of him when I asked him for water refills. Cuz our sake-loving friends surely needed some more water ;)  OH, and it was HAPPY HOUR before 7, so that's why the guys ordered hot sake like crazy people!

It can feel a little cramped because of this, but there's some pretty good seating in back. We can usually squish in a party of 8 or so, and once the unpleasant business of rearranging the chairs and getting ourselves into our seats is done, it actually doesn't feel that squished!  It has been said before, but I'll say it again. Even though it's tacked onto the Metreon and the decor is kind of standardly, facelessly Japanese, the food is really quite good. The fish is fresh, the miso is warm and salty, and neither I nor my coworkers have ever had a bad dish, to the best of my knowledge. The menu isn't that inventive, but it has all your favorites - soba, tempura, California roll and all - prepared very nicely. They get a bit more creative with their special rolls, of course, and I even ordered the chef's pick sushi lunch last time and got something that (I think) contained squid, tobiko, and a hot sauce, that was surprising and tasty. No, not surprisingly tasty, I was pretty sure I would like it.  In San Francisco, which is also the land of a billion sushi restaurants, you might not feel compelled to go out of your way to eat at Sanraku. But if you happen to be in the area and are looking for a sizeable, reasonably-priced lunch comprised of standard Japanese fare, by golly, Sanraku might just be your place!"}, {"date": "2011-03-27", "rating": 5, "comment": "Very high quality. Sometimes I have dreams about the teriyaki chicken from here and wake up sad that I am not already eating it. I have not found a better teriyaki place in SF.   The sushi was great here, too.

SESAME CHICKEN: I was in NJ and told a gentleman in the food and beverage business that I lived in SF. He said, \"Do you know where to find the bests sesame chicken in the country? Sanraku\". It is very good, fried, savory, served with salad. Get the combo with sashimi and you won't be disappointed.  NOODLES: The Nabayaki Udon is off the hook on a cold day.

Once we were seated and began to look at the menu, we noticed a delicious smell of chili waffing through. WHERE can we get some? We were a bit distracted. The menu at Sanraku is rather limited unfortunately. We settled on the today's special lunch box (miso soup, tempura vegetables, gyoza, wakame salad, $9.95) and the caterpillar roll ($11). Hmm...this is pretty pricey. It better be good. Everything was mediocre at best. The tempura was soggy. My caterpillar roll was small. I've had much bigger roll elsewhere for around $8-9.

In fact, I think just yesterday that I enjoyed perhaps my best meal yet at their restaurant.   A quick note about my sushi tastes- I prefer nigiri- and usually don't order any rolls, or even look on the menu for them. I am more interested in trying new and different types (species) of fish than I am in trying different types of creative rolls. So my user reviews will reflect that. Anyways, after a movie at the Metreon, we sat at the sushi bar and pummeled about 35+ pieces of nigiri. Chu-toro- excellent. Zuke-maguro- excellent. Hamachi belly- excellent. Anago- excellent. Kanpachi- excellent. Katsuo- excellent. We did order the spicy tuna roll and that was tasty as well. Everything was excellent, tasted very fresh, and was reasonably priced to my expectations- though not cheap- three of us splurged for a $160 bill before tip (no alcohol). But such are the terms I am accustomed to with my sushi habit.... I enjoyed the great variety of fish they had- perhaps 20+ different options, and they have a fairly extensive non-sushi menu as well for those interested in different options.  Please note that they have a new 'main' entrance from the exterior of the Metreon building due to the renovation currently going on. I am used to entering from the interior, however that has been cut-off, and now you must enter from the exterior by the Yerba Buena Gardens. I was a bit confused about how to find my way in at first, and I hope this has not injured their business.   Anyways, this place is super convenient and provides sushi of excellent quality. While I wouldn't classify it as a 'destination' sushi restaurant that I would specifically go to for a dinner/lunch etc, I will consistently patronize them if I am in the area shopping, for a movie, etc. Compares favorably to places such as Ten Ichi on Fillmore or Sushi Bistro."}, {"date": "2010-10-08", "rating": 4, "comment": "It would be a 3 if it weren't located in a \"mall\" or the Metreon.

Sushi overlooking the Gardens seemed like the OBVIOUS right choice. For $10 I got a Sushi Combo with 4 different rolls. AWESOME!   It came with a Miso &amp; Salad too! The Salad has interesting additions to it that I picked out and ate, but ended up sacrificing the rest of it to save room for all that Sushi! I was eating alone, so...

Accessible bathrooms located in the Metreon.   Sanraku has other locations, but this one is closest to me. While the Metreon is more than a bit dismal these days, Sanraku is a bright and pleasant spot despite it all, hidden from most of the mall and facing Yerba Buena's gardens. It's too small for groups, but there's usually seating at both the sushi bar and tables.   A real standout is their happy hour; 3-7 M-F (and maybe weekends) for drink specials, a wide variety of sake, and little plates of food, tapas-size. These include salads and tofu, half-size rolls, and a good variety of nibbly bits you can easily make a meal out of for quite cheap. My partner hits their happy hour regularly enough to keep us in constant coupons - they have a frequent-diner program that keeps him in maintenance sushi. Equally important, the service is always great, cheerful attentive waitstaff and consistently tasty food. The full dinner menu is also tasty, with enough options to feed vegetarians and people who won't eat that weird raw fish stuff, as well as lots of the usual rolls and entrees.   Allergy note: if you're one of the other three people who (like me) are allergic to seaweed, this Sanraku sometimes has soy paper available and will make you custom rolls that won't make you choke. I am shy and only ask for this once in a while when they aren't busy, but it's very nice to have that option.   If you need food on either side of a movie, a happy hour meetup after work, or are looking for a place to take a bunch of conference-goers that won't break your budget or your spirit, Sanraku is a great choice.

Out of all the options (and really there weren't that many at the Metreon) we decided on Sanraku. They had their daily lunch special on display (a bento box with tempura, vegetables, gyoza, rice, cold seaweed salad, california roll, miso soup, and rice) so we both ordered it.  The tempura was fine: nice and crispy. The California roll was warm, so that was a bit off-putting, and it ended up tasting pretty bland. The gyozas didn't really stand out either, in terms of flavor. The cold seaweed salad was the lone stand out of this dish, and even then, the portion was so small it really didn't compensate for everything else.   I'm sure if we tried the actual sushi rolls instead of the bento box, we'd have a different experience, but stay away from the lunch special."}, {"date": "2011-08-25", "rating": 4, "comment": "Happy hour drinks and food were a delicious bargain.

This may make me sound odd, but I like the fact that when I walk into a sushi/Izakaya establishment, that the wait staff as well as the sushi chefs are speaking Nihongo.

The Gindara was amazing and natsukashii, as they state in Nihongo. Remember that scene from Ratatouille where Anton Ego is whisked away to early childhood experience?? My grandmother use to grill this fish for me during my visits to Japan.....she would marinade the butter fish (so aptly named for it's flakey yet buttery texture....a bit more firm than salmon) in a mix of sake kasu and miso.  The Karage was mediocre as was the gyoza. The negihama, I personally am not into plain plain rolls unless it was a nigiri. But the Salmon/Avo roll was good. The salmon was extremely fresh.  When we rose to go, the sushi chefs spoke Nihongo to our party, although I think they felt the inclination to do so because of K.

I was disappointed Sanraku did not serve real wasabi with their sushi. I ordered the two spicy deep fried rolls (whose names I cannot recall) and those were delicious and I highly recommend them.   I was waiting for the waitress to come by so I could order some green tea ice cream but either she went off shift or stopped serving me for other reasons. But a different waitress come by and dropped off my check with a small dish of fresh fruit. I gave her a dirty look until she figured out I wanted to order dessert. After getting my green tea ice cream, I waited around some more waiting for my check again. I was sitting directly behind the hostess desk and the place had 10 people max in it but still no one came. Finally I got up and walked over to the register just so I could get out of there."}, {"date": "2010-01-03", "rating": 3, "comment": "Dear Yelp Journal,  After finishing my Christmas shopping and hitting up every H&amp;M in downtown San Francisco, I felt it was time to get my chow down. I was really hungry and didn't really know if I wanted to wait to go back to San Mateo to eat. Since I was walking by the Metreon to go back to my car anyway I decided to go inside.  I had already eaten at the farmers market before and wasn't all too interested in eating in that lonely room. I went to the restaurants and thought about what price range I wanted to eat in and what I was craving. My choices were between here and Buckhorn grill. I didn't want beef so I decided to go for sushi.  When I walked up to the restaurant there was a plastic display of their bento box, so that's what I ordered. Sometimes decisions are hard so that made it way easy. The portions came out looking huge, but funny thing Journal, after eating it all I was still hungry. It's OK though, the bento box itself was really cheap, especially considering it was in the Metreon. There was tempura, vegetables, wakame salad, and california rolls. It was only OK tasting, but they used some tasty artificial crab in their california rolls. I think I would be willing to come back."}, {"date": "2006-01-11", "rating": 4, "comment": "It could just be that I'm used to expensive sushi places, but this place seemed reasonably priced to me.

A note on masu: If you like-a da sake, then this is the best way to have it, I think. The server comes out with saucers and places them on the table, then she places these boxes (called masu, in case you haven't grokked that yet) on the saucers.

The tako (octopus) was good, too. The lunch combination, though, was less of a success. The teriyaki steak was completely overcooked while the broccoli that came with it was underdone.

Paul had sesame chicken, and I ordered the teriayaki chicken combo lunch with chef's choice sushi--yummy! Shrimp, tuna, yellowtail, and salmon.   You can imagine my surprise when I received beef teriyaki.   Yes, I could have asked them to correct this. I didn't want to wait for another order to come as it would have pushed our lunch out another 15 minutes. So, I ate it. The beef was very good, tender, juicy, but little teriyaki flavor to be had. They use rib-eye steak for the beef, so that is good news. All in all, a bit disappointing.   To top it off, it took forever to get our check. It's a good thing we have an hour for lunch.

It wasn't the BEST sushi I've ever tried, but it was decent enough where it left me smiling. The only thing that I didn't like too much was that their prices were hefty and at the table we were at, there was just a thin little wall that separated us from another table on the other side - and they were loud.

I'll comment specifically on the sushi bar; I've never eaten from their kitchen.  I guess if you like a lot of rolls smeared with overwhelming sauces, you won't notice that the fish is meh. It's like the good sushi joints got all the best fish, and Sanraku settled for the rest. The kanpachi, hamachi toro, uni, ikura, and tai were all unremarkable, but still good enough to eat. The fish tasted as if it had been refrigerating for about three days -- perfectly safe, but the tissue was not at its prime. The chu-toro stood out as the only thing that was delicious.  Unfortunately, they give you only two pieces of fish when you order it as sashimi, compared to most other places, which price their sashimi differently and give you 4 to 6 slices! Because of this odd choice, fish, when presented on a plate, feel anemic, like afterthoughts instead of bursts of fleshy color suggestive of the satisfying mouthfuls to follow. If you appreciate good knife skills, Sanraku's friendly if unengaging sushi chefs don't. All 8 of my dinky sashimi pieces looked as if they'd been cut by half as many different chefs.  Service, when it's busy, can be slow. Like Blowfish, the wait staff are more in the way than useful (remember, you're at a sushi BAR -- what do you need a waiter for?), particularly if you've been spoiled elsewhere by a personable, chatty itamae with whom you have direct and constant contact.

I have a soy allergy, which throws the staff a curve ball here and there, but our server was very graceful about it.  At best the sushi can be described as generic, yet a step up from picking up sushi at the super market. With that said, highlights included the spicy scallop roll and the monk fish liver, and the regrets were absolutely the spider roll and the uni. Interestingly enough I could even criticize the rice here, which was poorly seasoned, and in general I'm not one to dwell much on rice.   I'd recommend getting the Katana, a nice sake, but get a big bottle if you're two at it. The small is very small.

I must say that the texture of their tempura was nice and crispy...not soggy...thank goodness!  They don't really get creative with their sushi. California roll, rainbow roll, phili roll. Eh who cares! I'll eat any kind of rolls. I know we ordered tons of sushi for just the 4 of us. All were good but not great.  My friend really wanted to finish off with dessert. We got mango ice cream mochi balls and green tea creme brulee. Here is were it went downhill. Loved the mochi balls...can't ever go wrong with that. But the green tea creme brulee...good in theory but yuck! My friend and his wife said it tasted like baby food. Since I haven't eaten baby food since I was a baby I didnt really know if that was a good thing or bad thing.   Yuck! poor babies! It wasnt sweet enough and it had a really weird consistancy.

What has happened to this place??  So, the waiter brings water to our table, and as he is setting down our glasses, he spills the other two on his tray, and all over the floor. Hahaha, we are all laughing, it's funny, whatever, shit happens, other employees come to help clean up. The precarious way he had set his tray down nearby, with one of the emptied glasses perched atop, caused the thing to shift, with said emptied glass to threaten a fall directly onto the boy's head, eliciting gasps from surrounding patrons. Oh the poor dear, we think, and we all laugh some more... OK that's over with, my friend and I figure out, pretty quickly, what we want. Let the fun commence....  So we wait for the guy to come back.  Two other tables get seated.  And we wait.... and we wait.  He takes their orders first.  And we wait some more. Remember, we had already decided what we wanted.  My low blood sugar is not helping things along.  \"Oh are you ready to order?\" He says, after he finally returns. Our menus have been closed for quite some time at this point, by the way.  We ordered, and at least our food appeared to come out before the other two aforementioned tables, and in a relatively timely fashion. Man, though, four bucks for a half cup of Costco lookin' seaweed salad? Come on! Not only that, but one of the \"specials\" consists of 6 nigiri and 6 California rolls.... for $18. What was I thinking?? Oh yeah, it was actually *cheaper* that way. Whiskey tango foxtrot!  To add insult to injury, the raw fish nigiri had wasabi spread underneath the pieces of fish (when was the last time that was an acceptable norm??), the yellowtail was all pulled apart and ugly, the salmon looked a bit off-color on the corners, and the California rolls looked like they came from Safeway. The vegetarian \"special\" platter was halfway decent, at least, and I must say the eggplant nigiri was rather heavenly. That was the only thing that impressed me. Period.  This is not as I remembered my last trip here! That was back when I was naive and silly and preferred hot sake to the cold unfiltered... tisk tisk tisk. At least the gyoza were somewhat decent. I came here for sushi, though, dammit, not glorified greasy dumplings.  The waiter was probably sufficiently embarrassed, and that somehow translated to some dire inattentiveness, I think: he sheepishly realized that he didn't replace our napkins that were used in the cleanup effort for the spilled water, and once our water needed refilling, he had to be flagged down. He was good about it thereafter, I'll give him that. This was on top of neglecting to take our order when we were obviously ready (remember, menus closed), however, and he all but disappeared when the time for the check came and went-- I had to go to the counter to request it and after it was brought to our table, I had to take it back to the counter to pay it. I know you're ashamed, sweetie, but come on, we still exist! Maybe he was just overworked. Who knows... I feel for the poor soul, yet my dissatisfaction unfortunately reigned supreme over my compassion. That's just the bare truth.  The last time I was here, I don't remember it being this overpriced (including the unfiltered sake-- $18 for a lackluster bottle!!) or this bad-- and I could have handled the expense if it weren't for the lack of quality. Next time, I'll pack my dinner or dine elsewhere when I go to the Metreon for my IMAX experience.  At least THAT (300) was freaking awesome. My bootlegged Sparks helped.

I ordered a spicy tuna roll and one order of hamachi nigiri and the total came to about $15. This seems pretty steep considering the quality. The fish, especially the hamachi, was not fresh.

If you can get the attention of a staff member, chances are he or she will be very friendly, but again, that's if you can get their attention.  ____________________ Okay, on the second visit I had better service. However, I am still confounded by the prices. $30 for two small rolls and two orders of sushi? It's ridiculous.

The sunomono was good, the salad's nothing special, I'd give it a miss. The Akitabare sake was excellent.  The second evening, a friend who was after Japanese food and I went back and sat at the sushi bar. I had clam misoshiru, tuna zake (maguro marinated in jalapeno-laced sauce, with diced jalapeno bits on it), hotate (Hokkaido scallops), negihamachimaki (yellowtail and scallions roll), and hirame (halibut). These were all excellent, although the maguro gets lost in the jalapeno with the tuna zake. My friend had a set meal with misoshiru, assorted sashimi, and tempura, and reported it to be very good.

Kinda average for our tasting. Just a tad bit pricy for Lunch that didnt come with salad.   Yesterday, we happened to stumble in after shop'n at the Sony Playstation store because we were both hungry. We looked around &amp; saw this restaurant. The menu was posted outside the entrance so we peeked in to see if it was crowded, but it wasn't. As soon as we got in, we were seated. Few minutes later, the waiter asked if we wanted something to drink before we ordered. Of course, My Xo &amp; I usually have to order the tea. When the waiter came back, we were expecting a kettle of tea. Instead, we got 1 cup each. Anyhow, we ordered the spicy hamachi &amp; the philly for appetizers, I ordered the vegetable tempura (alot of veggies) &amp; my Xo ordered the chicken donburi (didn't come with egg, just grilled veggies). Our orders came with the miso soup. During the middle of eating, our tea kept running out, so we had to flag the waiter. He came out with a kettle of tea to which we thought he was going to leave the kettle so he wouldnt have to go back &amp; forth to serve us the tea. Obviously NOT! Everytime we finished our tea, we had to flag him down. The host kept checking up on us &amp; served us more of the tea than our waiter.

It is so good -- chock full of raw fish, you name it, maguro, hamachi, uni, LOTS of salmon roe and tobiko over spring green mix. I don't like to fill up on rice so this meal is perfect. I've been to Sanraku a couple of times and my favorite is still the sashimi salad. Their fish is sooo fresh and excellent quality -- melts in your mouth, really. I recommend this place. The only drawback is it's not the best atmosphere (located in the Metreon complex) -- it is a bit noisy and very bright lights and a pretty small space.

When I went tonight, for example, I ordered a gyoza, a rock-n-roll, and a negi-hama roll. The gyoza, while tasty, is still pretty average in it's serving size.

The roll had a little too much off every ingredient: salmon, yellow tail, shrimp, asparagus, avocado, chives, soy paper, and seaweed. Very little flavor, and certainly not worth the price tag. Service was not accommodating: water was not refilled, and would not let us substitute tuna sashimi for salmon.

Let me sum up what is likely to be a TL;DR review, just for those of you who want the bare facts: OH MY GOD COCKROACH.   Let me repeat &amp; clarify that: OH MY GOD COCKROACH. ON THE TABLE. HIDING UNDER MY BOWL. WAVING IT'S ANTENNAE AT ME. \"HELLO, JEN!\"  Okay. Rewind a few weeks. I'm visiting Leslie in the city, and we're going to see (500) Days of Summer at the Metreon and want to grab a bite to eat beforehand; I've been craving sashimi for days and days, so despite misgivings about Sanraku (the only previous time I'd been, someone stole my sister's purse. That's right, woman with the red purse who \"stumbled\" into my sister's chair and walked off with her bag - we remember! *shakes fist* you suck!), that's where we opt to go. We go in and are promptly seated against the window and greeted by a frankly sullen server. Fast-forward 20 or so minutes, and sullenness aside, we're enjoying our fairly tasty if standard Japanese mall-food, when I catch a glimpse of too many legs out of the corner of my eye.  I just barely see a couple legs disappearing below the table, so I scoot my chair back a bit, saying \"Bug? I think I saw a bug? Or I'm hallucinating?\" and stick my head down (SPOILER ALERT: in the alternate ending, this is where I get my head crunched off in a frenzy of blood, screaming, and maniacally waving feelers) but I can't see it anywhere, so I crane forward just a little more... Which is when Leslie's chair screeches backwards and she jumps up and says \"Jen, Jen, it's on the table!\" ON THE TABLE NEXT TO MY FACE. So I jump up, and by this time, our diffident server and some other guy have come up and are making \"Hmm.\" faces at us.. The cockroach skitters around on the table for a few minutes and then decides to hide under my bowl, antennae waving furiously. Leslie and I back away from the table, and our server steps gingerly forward with a napkin, picks up the cockroach...and promptly drops it. It skitters to the wall, thinks for a second, and hies itself back to the dark corner from whence it came...under somebody else's table. (Where, to my knowledge, it rests to this very day, as the people at that table were enjoying a rather large sake and very tiny food and subsequently didn't notice any of our \"Oh my god bug!\" exclamations.)  At this point, Leslie and I have no further interest in eating, and we ask for a discount on our meal, at which point, after much server-hostess conferring and calling of the manager (who says, in response to the hostess' \"What should we do?\": \"Nothing!\"), we are given a whopping 10% off. We pay, shuddering and clutching at each other all the while, and flee. We confer in the lobby of the Metreon for a few minutes and decide that we shouldn't have paid at all, and return to the hostess' desk, whereupon she says \"Oh good, I was thinking you should probably get a little bit more off..\" So she gives us another 30% off, takes down Leslie's phone number, and promises that the company will call her tomorrow. WHICH THEY NEVER DO. Then we go upstairs to wait for the movie, call everyone we have ever met, and are comforted by the sweet sweater-vest stylings of one Mr. Joseph Gordon-Levitt.  FIN.  I generally am pretty easygoing when it comes to food; I've done my time in food service and am about to return to it; I recognize that bugs are usually all over the damn place and when I go out to eat I just pretend I don't know that. But it is one thing to know that there's probably cockroaches and a couple mice in the kitchen, and another for those (HUGE, SO HUGE) cockroaches to be so comfortable around people that THEY CRAWL UP ON YOUR TABLE TO SAY HI AND COMPLETELY SPOIL YOUR MAGURO SASHIMI. I really wish I'd had the presence of mind to yank out my camera and take a picture, because I'm not kidding when I say that it was 3 inches long, NOT COUNTING THE ANTENNAE. ugh.  Moral of the story: Whatever, bugs happen, but for God's sake, the management should have comped our meal and fallen all over themselves apologizing (or at least apologized once! Just once!). It was gross - and if you watch too many Sci-Fi Movies of the Week, like I do - downright terrifying!  (I really want to watch Mimic now, though.

Did the handful of peeps who review this place get paid to slam it or what? We've been coming here for years as we live around the corner. We don't go out of our way to eat here, but when we have a hankering for pizza, this place surely does it.   I love their thin, crispy crust. The pizza most certainly NEVER sits out as previously mentioned (don't assume it, just to slam it). We've nearly almost gotten a fresh slice from the fired oven, as they go through a lot of food and constantly are making new pizzas.   Someone mentioned their cheese pizza was oily? Ummmm, hello it's CHEESE PIZZA bonehead! lmao. And to be honest I've had oilier.   I don't mind the hours they are open, and in fact I'm glad they cater to a late night munchies crowd, especially in this hood. (The only downside is that by that time there is not much to choose from, as it's all sold out - which proves my point again, their pizza sells out and does NOT sit out).   What's funny is that we actually had a pepperoni and veggie pizza earlier today for a snack, and it was superb. I must mention again, they this crust is simply divine.   (And to the dude who was a drunk bonehead with his buddies laughing at the moth behind the glass, and the poor worker looking at them like wtf?

Needless to say, I didn't expect much when I popped into Pizza Pomodoro for my first slice of authentic New York style pizza.  And my low expectations were definitely met.

Hoping to add a little flavor to my slice of dull veggie galore, I spotted some shakers of grated parmesan and garlic seasoning on the countertop. I liberally covered my slice with a mix of the two, in a final attempt to enhance the sad, pathetic slice.  But to no avail. Now I was just eating too much dry seasoning atop mushy veggies, and a burnt crust. The bland crust was blackened on the edges, ironic, considering how my pizza was lukewarm, despite having just been reheated in the oven.   http://static1.px.yelp...
